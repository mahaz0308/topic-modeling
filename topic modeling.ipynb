The Petitioner intends \\nto contest the election for \\nthe \\nBOD\\n \\nof the \\nC\\nompan\\ny for which he filed \\nhis nomination papers and consent forms \\nas required \\nunder the Act. \\nLearned counsel \\nfor the Petitioner \\nargued that the \\nC\\nompany has set a \\ntotal strength of \\neleven\\n \\ndirectors \\nfor\\n \\nits \\nBOD\\n \\nand \\nthereafter \\ninvited \\ninterested \\ncandidates to take\\n \\npart in the \\nelection\\n. Learned counsel \\nfurther argued that \\nin this context the Federal Government proposed \\nsome names of members and non\\n-\\nmembers who will contest the \\nelections on \\nits \\nbehalf.\\n \\nLearned counsel argued that the Federal \\nGovernment through letter\\n \\ndated 9.6.2020 addressed to Respondent \\nNo.3 nominated \\neleven\\n \\npersons to contest the election for the \\nBOD \\nof \\nRespondent No.3 under Section 159 of the Act.

Learned \\ncounsel stated\\n \\nthat this issue has already been decided by this Court \\nthrough judgment dated 27.2.2020 passed \\nin \\nWP No.\\n21451/2019 \\ntitled \\nMian Misbah\\n-\\nur\\n-\\nRehman v. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited \\nthrough its Secretary etc\\n.\\n \\nand \\n \\nthe Federal Government is acting in \\ncontr\\navention to the law laid down by this Court.\\n \\nTherefore \\nthe \\nPetitioner prays that the persons mentioned in the\\n \\nletter dated \\n9\\n.6.2020 \\nissued by the\\n \\nFederal Government should be barred from contesting \\nthe election as they are not members of the company in the\\nir \\nown \\nright\\n \\nand \\nas such \\nthey cannot represent the Federal Government as an \\nelected director. \\nLearned counsel argued that the same will apply to \\nthe nominees of State Life Insurance Corporation and National \\nInvestment Trust \\nLimited \\nwho are also not members\\n \\nof the \\nRespondent No.3 \\nC\\nompany. \\n \\n3.\\n \\nEffectively the case of the Petitioner is that the Federal \\nGovernment \\nbeing member of SNGPL cannot contest elections in \\nterms of Section 159 of the Act and that it can only nominate directors \\nunder Section 164 and 165 o\\nf the Act. The Petitioner consequently \\nargues that the Federal Government can only nominate three persons \\nto the BOD under Section 165 of the Act.\\n \\nArguments of \\n\\ncounsel\\n \\n4\\n.\\n \\nOn behalf of the Federal Government report and parawise \\ncomments have be\\nen filed. Learned DAG stated that \\n\\nreference to \\nWP No.21451/2019 (\\nsupra\\n)\\n \\nis totally misconceived. In \\nfact the \\nFederal Government\\n \\nbased on the findings in the said case \\ndecided to propose candidates to contest the election under Section \\n159 \\nof the Act. She argued that \\nthe Petitioner has no \\nlocus standi\\n \\nbefore this Court and in fact the instant Petition \\nraises \\na company \\ndispute \\nfor which \\nremedy \\nis \\navailable under \\nSection 160 of \\nthe Act. \\nShe stated that the Federal Government is exercising its \\nrights as a \\nshareholder strictly in accordance with law and that Section 153(i)(\\ni\\n) \\n',\n",
       " '4\\n \\nWP No.\\n27842\\n/2020\\n \\nof the Act read with its proviso is self\\n-\\nexplanatory wherein the \\nFederal Government \\ncan appoint directors who are \\nnon\\n-\\nmember\\ns\\n \\nto \\nrepresent it in the election of\\n \\nthe BOD\\n. She\\n \\nexplained that \\nthe \\nMinistry of Energy, Petroleum Division pr\\no\\nposed the names of \\ncandidates to contest \\nthe election for the \\nBOD\\n. \\nEleven names \\nwere \\nprovided which are duly mentioned in the election notice and the \\nadvertisement. Since the \\nFederal Government\\n \\nis a shareholder of \\nRespondent No.3, it is merely exercising its right as a shareholder \\nand \\nhas opted to appoint directors by election being distinct from \\nnomine \\ndirectors. \\n \\n5\\n.\\n \\nOn behalf of \\nthe \\nSECP, report and parawise comments have \\nbeen filed\\n.

It is their case that as per the provisions \\nof the Act, there is no restriction on the number of persons \\nwho can\\n \\ncon\\nt\\nest the election of directors as the election shall be conducted as \\nper \\nthe \\nprocedure laid down in Section 159 of t\\nhe Act\\n.

He has also raised\\n \\nobjections on the maintainability of this \\n',\n",
       " '5\\n \\nWP No.\\n27842\\n/2020\\n \\nPetition\\n \\nand\\n \\nthe locus standi of the Petitioner.\\n \\nLearned counsel \\nexplained that the shareholders of SNGPL comprises of 634,216,665 \\nshares and the required threshold for a member to participate \\nin the \\nelection is t\\nhe holding of 9.09% shares. The Petitioner does not meet \\nthis threshold, hence cannot allege any grievance or breach of any \\nright. The Federal Government is a member holding 31.68% shares \\ndirectly and 57.68% shares through government owned entities, \\ncorpor\\nations and companies bringing its total shareholding to over \\n70%. Hence the Federal Government can contest elections in its own \\nright as a member of SNGPL and can name non\\n-\\nmembers as its \\ncandidates to contest the election in terms of Section 153 of the Act\\n.\\n \\n7\\n.\\n \\nLearned counsel for \\nRespondent No.22 clarified that \\nRespondent \\nNo.2\\n2\\n \\nhas withdrawn from the election process, hence he \\nis no longer contesting the election. \\nLearned counsel for Respondent \\nNo.21 provided a copy of order dated \\n16.3.2020 \\npassed \\nby this C\\nourt \\nin \\nICA No.14622/2020 titled \\nMian Misbah\\n-\\nur\\n-\\nRehman v. SNGPL and \\nothers\\n \\nwherein he \\nraised an objection \\nwith respect to the election \\nof \\nthe BOD \\nwherein \\na \\nstatus quo order has been passed, hence \\nprays that \\nthis Court should not proceed with the \\ncase \\nuntil\\n \\na \\ndecision is made in \\nthe \\naforementioned \\nICA.\\n \\nLearned counsel for Respondent No.24 \\nessentially argued that \\nthere is no concept of non\\n-\\nnatural person \\ncontesting election of the BOD in terms of Section 154 of the Act.\\n \\nLearned counsel further argued that the\\nre is nothing in the law which \\nbars a non\\n-\\nnatural person from directing a natural person to offer \\nhimself for election and then vote for such person in the election to be \\nconducted\\n, meaning that it can give its proxy to a member.\\n \\nIn fact, it \\nappears to be \\ncommon practice for non\\n-\\nnatural persons to transfer the \\nrequisite shareholding in favour of persons it desires to contest \\nelection \\nso that the requirement of Section 159(3) and Section 153 \\nmay be met\\n \\nas\\n \\na\\nny such person who offers himself for election would\\n \\nhave to be a member in his own right. \\nLearned counsel \\nalso \\nargued \\n',\n",
       " '6\\n \\nWP No.\\n27842\\n/2020\\n \\nthat a person offering himself for elections has to be a member and \\nthere can be no exception to the same, therefore it is clear that there is \\nno concept of a non\\n-\\nnatural person contesting \\nelections under the \\napplicable law. \\nLearned counsel argued that there is no concept of a \\n\\nrelation to a BOD of a company under the Act is persons being \\nnominated to a BOD directly without goi\\nng through the process of \\nelections under Sections 164 and 165 of the Act.\\n \\n \\nPreliminary Objections\\n \\n8\\n.\\n \\nLearned counsel for Respondent\\ns\\n \\nraised three preliminary \\nobjections.\\n \\nFirstly that \\nthe Petitioner has appropriate, efficacious and \\nalternate remedy availab\\nle to him under Section 160 of the Act\\n;\\n \\nSecondly \\nthat \\nthe Petitioner \\nhas no \\nlocus standi\\n \\nto \\nfile the instant \\nPetition \\nas no fundamental right of the Petitioner has been infringed\\n; \\nThirdly\\n,\\n \\nSection 5(2) of the Act \\nis an ouster clause which ousts the \\njurisdi\\nction \\nof this Court \\nspecifically\\n \\non matters related to election of \\ndirectors which are to be dealt with exclusively by the Company \\nBench of the High Court having jurisdiction. \\nReliance is placed on\\n \\nMuhammad Shafique Khan Sawati v. Federation of Pakistan et\\nc\\n. \\n(\\n2015 SCMR 851\\n),\\n \\nMian Javed Amir v. United Foam Industries \\n(Pvt.) Ltd. etc\\n. (\\n2016 SCMR 213\\n) and \\nM. Fuwad A. Mughal v. \\nFederation of Pakistan etc\\n. (\\n2018 YLR 26\\n).\\n \\n9\\n.\\n \\nWith respect to the first objection that remedy under Section \\n160 of the Act is available\\n \\nto the Petitioner who \\nseeks to \\nchallenge the \\neligibility of \\neleven\\n \\ncandidates \\nnamed by \\nthe Federal Government for \\nthe purposes of election\\n \\nto the BOD\\n. Section 160 of the Act provides\\n \\nthat the Company Bench of the \\nrelevant \\nHigh Court can\\n \\ndeclare \\nthe \\nelecti\\non of directors invalid on an application of a member holding \\n10% of the voting power in the company \\nfiled \\nwithin the \\nthirty \\ndays \\nfrom the date of election\\n,\\n \\nif there is material irregularity in \\nthe \\nholding \\nof the elections and matters incidental or related\\n \\nthereto. The \\n',\n",
       " '7\\n \\nWP No.\\n27842\\n/2020\\n \\ncontention is that the Petitioner does not have \\nlocus standi\\n \\nunder \\nSection 160 of the Act as he does not have the requisite 10% of the \\nvoting power. \\nS\\nince he does not qualify for the remedy under Section \\n160 of the Act, he cannot bypass the m\\nandatory provisions of the \\nAct \\nand challenge \\nthe \\nelections\\n \\nthrough this Petition. \\nIn this regard, it is \\n\\nchallenge \\nis specifically with the \\ndecision \\nof the Federal Government to put up \\neleven \\ncandidates \\nfor \\nthe election \\nto the BO\\nD of SNGPL on the ground that the Federal Government \\ncannot put up any candidates to par\\nticipate in the election of d\\nirectors \\nand that\\n \\nby doing so they are abusing their authority and acting in \\nerror of law.\\n \\nIn this regard, it is noted that the entire disp\\nute is with \\nrespect to \\nthe \\ndecision of the Federal Government to participate in the \\nelections. Since the decision and actions of the Federal Government \\nhave been impugned before this Court, the instant Petition is \\nmaintainable and this Court in constitutio\\nnal jurisdiction can \\ndetermine whether or not \\nFederal \\nGovernment has acted in \\naccordance with law\\n \\nor whether it has abused its authority. \\nIn this \\nregard, it is noted that the powers under Section 160 vest\\ning\\n \\nwith the \\nCompany \\nBench of the \\nrelevant \\nHigh \\nCour\\nt \\nis \\nthe power \\nto determine \\nwhether or not the elections\\n \\nhave been conducted\\n \\nunder the Act and \\ndo\\nes\\n \\nnot deal with the \\njudicial review of \\nactions\\n \\nor decisions\\n \\nof the \\nFederal \\nGovernment \\nchallenged as interference \\nin \\nthe election \\nprocess.\\n \\nSection 160 of the A\\nct is a statutory right of a shareholder to \\nensure that elections of directors \\nare conducted under the Act as \\nrequired and this provision is not available to the Petitioner to \\nchallenge the actions of the Federal Government. Hence there is no \\nmerit in this\\n \\nobjection. \\nSo far as the issue of \\nlocus standi\\n \\nis concerned, \\nfor the purposes of constitutional jurisdiction the Petitioner claims to \\nbe aggrieved as he is a member of SNGPL and does not want the \\nFederal Government to usurp his rights as a member who want\\ns to \\ncontest elections for the BOD.\\n \\n',\n",
       " '8\\n \\nWP No.\\n27842\\n/2020\\n \\n10\\n.\\n \\nWith respect to the \\nthird \\nobjection \\non the ouster of jurisdiction, \\nSection 5(2) of the Act \\nprovides that \\nNotwithstanding anything \\ncontained in any other law no civil court as provided in the Code of \\nCivil Procedure, \\n1908 or any other court shall have jurisdiction to \\nentertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the \\nCourt \\nis empowered to determine by or under this Act. \\nIn terms of this \\nSection, the jurisdiction of \\na \\ncivil court or any other court\\n \\nhas \\nbeen \\nousted to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter \\nwhich the court is empowered to determine by or under this Act. \\nConsequently Section 5(2) of the Act vests jurisdiction with the \\nCompany Bench of the \\nrelevant \\nHigh Court\\n \\nto deal with \\nall matters \\nunder the Act. \\nWhile interpreting \\nthe ouster clause, the august \\nSupreme Court of Pakistan has in several cases held that the ouster \\nclause \\nhas to be interpreted strictly and based on the \\nfacts \\nof the case. \\nMore specifically that the ouster clau\\nse cannot be read or inferred to \\noust constitutional jurisdiction. \\n \\n11.\\n \\nIn \\nAllied Bank of Pakistan Ltd. v. Khalid Farooq\\n \\n(\\n1991 SCMR \\n599\\n), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:\\n \\nthe exclusion \\nof jurisdiction of superior Courts is not to be \\nreadily \\ninferred\\n, that there is a strong leaning against any such exclusion, \\nthat this rule is deep seated and if it is to be overtu\\nr\\nned, it must \\nordinarily be done by a clear, definite or positive provision, not left \\nto mere implication\\n. \\n \\n \\nIn \\nMunir Hussai\\nn Bhatti, Advocate and others v. Federation of \\nPakistan and another\\n \\n(\\nPLD 2011 SC 407\\n), the august Supreme Court \\nof Pakistan has held as under:\\n \\nThere\\n \\nis \\na vast body of precedent in our legal corpus which has \\n\\nay only be ousted \\nthrough express words in a legal text. This principle of law is by \\nnow well settled. \\n \\n \\nIn \\nArshad Mehmood v. Commissioner/Delimitation Authority, \\nGujranwala and others\\n \\n(\\nPLD 2014 Lahore 221\\n), it has been held\\n \\nthat\\n:\\n \\n',\n",
       " '9\\n \\nWP No.\\n27842\\n/2020\\n \\nThe ouster clause under S\\nection 10A of the Act \\ndoes not, in the slightest, \\nabridge or curtail the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court to judicially \\nreview the orders, notifications and the acts of the executive i.e., the \\nDelimitation Authority and Delimitation Officer in thi\\ns case. \\nIt also \\nmatters little if the ouster clause is considered to be a time specific clause, \\nas argued by some of the respondents. Courts usually give due weightage \\nto any administrative urgency of the Executive but this does not mean that \\nthe doors lea\\nding to courts can be shut down as this would result in \\ncurtailing and abridging the judicial power. This is opposed to \\nindependence of judiciary \\nand the constitutional framework of separation \\nof powers. \\n \\n \\nAs per \\ncitations the ouster clause must be read in\\n \\nthe \\ncontext \\nof the\\n \\nlanguage \\nof the \\nstatute\\n. So far as constitutional jurisdiction \\nis \\nconcerned, this Court will guard its jurisdiction \\njealously \\nand \\nwill not\\n \\noust its constitutional jurisdiction on inference\\n \\nas Section 5(2) \\nof the \\nAct \\ndoes not explicitly \\nbar \\n\\n. \\n \\n12.\\n \\nIn \\nthe instant case\\n, the \\nouster clause\\n \\nspecifically mention\\ns\\n \\ncivil \\ncourts or any other court to entertain suits or proceedings\\n \\nin respect \\nof matters which the Company Bench of the High Court has \\njurisdiction\\n \\nby or \\nunder \\nth\\ne\\n \\nAct, meaning thereby that \\nno other c\\no\\nurt \\ncan interfere in matters for which jurisdiction has been specifically \\nvested with the Company Bench of the \\nrelevant \\nHigh Court\\n. \\nSection 5 \\nas the \\nouster clause\\n \\ndoes not protect unlawful actions and decisions\\n \\nof \\nt\\nhe government \\nwhich are otherwise amenable to judicial review \\nunder constitutional jurisdiction. \\nThe \\nouster clause\\n \\nprotects the \\njurisdiction of the Company Bench of the relevant High Court to \\nensure that no other \\ncourt impedes \\non its jurisdiction. \\nThe Comp\\nany \\nBench of the \\nrelevant \\nHigh Court\\n \\nunder Section 160 of the Act can\\n \\nconsider \\nirregularities in the election of directors wherein the \\nrequirements of the Act have not been followed or considered by it\\n \\nbut\\n \\ncannot consider issues which go beyond irregularit\\nies under the \\nAct.\\n \\nThe \\nouster clause\\n \\ntherefore does not cover decisions and actions \\ntaken \\nby\\n \\nthe executive being the Federal Government\\n \\nin this case\\n. \\nMore importantly \\nthe application of Section 5 of the Act will not \\n \\nin any manner \\ncurb\\n \\nthe jurisdiction ves\\nted \\nin this \\n \\n',\n",

A plain reading of Section 159\\n(3) \\nmakes it evi\\ndent that the \\nprovision \\nis procedural in nature which essentially lays down the \\nprocess to be followed for the purposes of election. Section 159(3) of \\nthe Act requires \\nany member\\n, be it a body corporate or the Federal or \\nProvincial Government, as the case \\nmay be, give their consent and \\nintimation to offer themselves for election as directors. It goes without \\nsaying that since the body corporate or the Federal or Provincial \\nGovernment will act through their representative who has to be a \\nnatural person, they\\n \\nwill follow the process under Section 159(3) and \\ngive their consent and intimation to the election. \\nConsequently \\nSection 159\\n(3)\\n \\nof the Act does not prohibit the rights of non\\n-\\nnatural \\npersons who are members \\nof a company \\nto appoint directors by \\nelection\\n \\non\\n \\nthe BOD. Hence\\n,\\n \\nt\\nhe Federal Government can appoint a \\nmember or non\\n-\\nmember as its candidate to participate in the election \\nfor the BOD of Respondent No.3.

Section 164 of the Act provides that \\nin addition to director elected or deemed to have been elected by \\nshareholders, the company may have directors nominated by its \\ncreditors or special \\ninterests by virtue of a contractual arrangement. A \\nbody corporate or corporation owned or controlled by the Federal or \\nProvincial Government may also nominate directors on the BOD to \\nsuch corporation or company that it has extended credit facilities. In \\nt\\nhe same manner Section 165 provides for the nomination of directors \\nrepresenting special interests where the Federal or Provincial \\nGovernment as the case may be to nominate a director in a company \\nin which it has made some investments or on the basis of an\\ny special \\ninterests. A nominee director therefore is nominated by institutions \\nsuch as financial institutions or the Federal or Provincial Government \\non the Board to protect its interests as nominator. The fundamental \\ndifference between a nominee director \\nand elected director is that a \\nnomine director holds office at the pleasure of the nominator whereas \\nthe elected director is given a three year tenure under the Act and \\nsecondly that a nominee director has to safeguard the interests of its \\nnominator \\nfirst \\nand foremost \\nwhereas an elected director has a \\nfiduciary duty to the company and \\nall \\nits shareholders.

The Petitioner is an advocate by profession and  a  shareholder in  Respondent No.3, SNGPL   holding 3000 shares . The Petitioner intends  to contest the election for  the  BOD   of the  C ompan y for which he filed  his nomination papers and consent forms  as required  under the Act.  Learned counsel  for the Petitioner  argued that the  C ompany has set a  total strength of  eleven   directors  for   its  BOD   and  thereafter  invited  interested  candidates to take   part in the  election . Learned counsel  further argued that  in this context the Federal Government proposed  some names of members and non - members who will contest the  elections on  its  behalf.   Learned counsel argued that the Federal  Government through letter   dated 9.6.2020 addressed to Respondent  No.3 nominated  eleven   persons to contest the election for the  BOD  of  Respondent No.3 under Section 159 of the Act. Out of these  eleven  persons only three are members of  SNGPL ,   in their own right ,   being  Roohi Raees Kh an, Rizwan Ullah Khan and Dr. Sohail Razi Khan.   The remaining  eight  persons are not members of SNGPL, hence not  e ligible to contest the election . Learned counsel  further  argued that  Section 159 of the Act makes it clear that a person contesting the  electio n   of directors   must be a member  in his own right  and  cannot be  construed  to be  representing anyone other than himself .  He stated that  Section 159 of the Act is  a  complete code which regulates  the  conduct  of elections, such that only a member of the  C ompany   can contest  the  election for the director of the  C ompany. He further  stated  that so far  as the Federal Government is concerned, they can  only  nominate  directors under Section 165 of the Act  and  cannot put up directors for  election under Section 159 of the   Act. He argued that elected directors  are totally separate and distinct from nominated directors  and the  Federal G overnment is trying to  blur  this distinction by  appointing  ',\n",
       " '3   WP No. 27842 /2020   directors  through elections, which the law does not permit . Learned  counsel stated   that this issue has already been decided by this Court  through judgment dated 27.2.2020 passed  in  WP No. 21451/2019  titled  Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman v. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited  through its Secretary etc .   and    the Federal Government is acting in  contr avention to the law laid down by this Court.   Therefore  the  Petitioner prays that the persons mentioned in the   letter dated  9 .6.2020  issued by the   Federal Government should be barred from contesting  the election as they are not members of the company in the ir  own  right   and  as such  they cannot represent the Federal Government as an  elected director.  Learned counsel argued that the same will apply to  the nominees of State Life Insurance Corporation and National  Investment Trust  Limited  who are also not members   of the  Respondent No.3  C ompany.    3.   Effectively the case of the Petitioner is that the Federal  Government  being member of SNGPL cannot contest elections in  terms of Section 159 of the Act and that it can only nominate directors  under Section 164 and 165 o f the Act. The Petitioner consequently  argues that the Federal Government can only nominate three persons  to the BOD under Section 165 of the Act.   Arguments of   counsel   4 .   On behalf of the Federal Government report and parawise  comments have be en filed. Learned DAG stated that   reference to  WP No.21451/2019 ( supra )   is totally misconceived. In  fact the  Federal Government   based on the findings in the said case  decided to propose candidates to contest the election under Section  159  of the Act. She argued that  the Petitioner has no  locus standi   before this Court and in fact the instant Petition  raises  a company  dispute  for which  remedy  is  available under  Section 160 of  the Act.  She stated that the Federal Government is exercising its  rights as a  shareholder strictly in accordance with law and that Section 153(i)( i )  ',\n",
       " '4   WP No. 27842 /2020   of the Act read with its proviso is self - explanatory wherein the  Federal Government  can appoint directors who are  non - member s   to  represent it in the election of   the BOD . She   explained that  the  Ministry of Energy, Petroleum Division pr o posed the names of  candidates to contest  the election for the  BOD .  Eleven names  were  provided which are duly mentioned in the election notice and the  advertisement. Since the  Federal Government   is a shareholder of  Respondent No.3, it is merely exercising its right as a shareholder  and  has opted to appoint directors by election being distinct from  nomine  directors.    5 .   On behalf of  the  SECP, report and parawise comments have  been filed . Learned co unsel  ha s   clarified that if a person holding  s hare s   in a company is not a natural person then such person can  nominate any person to contest the election  for   d irector on its behalf  in terms of Section 153(i)( i ) of the Act  and  that  such  person need not  be a   member of the company. It is their case that as per the provisions  of the Act, there is no restriction on the number of persons  who can   con t est the election of directors as the election shall be conducted as  per  the  procedure laid down in Section 159 of t he Act . Further   that an  artificial person can participate in the election through its nomination  of a natural person ,   who is not a member of the company.   6 .   Report and parawise comments have  also  been filed on behalf  of Respondent SNGPL.  Learned counsel ar gued that while proceeding  with the process for carrying out election for the  BOD   of SNGPL ,   t he  Federal  Government being a member of SNGPL has proposed  candidates to contest the election in terms of Section 159 of the Act.  There are  eleven  names proposed o ut of which some  are  members  holding proxy  on behalf of the Federal Government  while others are  not members but eligible in terms of Section 153 of the Act.  He stated  that SNGPL has acted  as per law and duly advertised the election  date. He has also raised   objections on the maintainability of this  ',\n",
       " '5   WP No. 27842 /2020   Petition   and   the locus standi of the Petitioner.   Learned counsel  explained that the shareholders of SNGPL comprises of 634,216,665  shares and the required threshold for a member to participate  in the  election is t he holding of 9.09% shares. The Petitioner does not meet  this threshold, hence cannot allege any grievance or breach of any  right. The Federal Government is a member holding 31.68% shares  directly and 57.68% shares through government owned entities,  corpor ations and companies bringing its total shareholding to over  70%. Hence the Federal Government can contest elections in its own  right as a member of SNGPL and can name non - members as its  candidates to contest the election in terms of Section 153 of the Act .   7 .   Learned counsel for  Respondent No.22 clarified that  Respondent  No.2 2   has withdrawn from the election process, hence he  is no longer contesting the election.  Learned counsel for Respondent  No.21 provided a copy of order dated  16.3.2020  passed  by this C ourt  in  ICA No.14622/2020 titled  Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman v. SNGPL and  others   wherein he  raised an objection  with respect to the election  of  the BOD  wherein  a  status quo order has been passed, hence  prays that  this Court should not proceed with the  case  until   a  decision is made in  the  aforementioned  ICA.   Learned counsel for Respondent No.24  essentially argued that  there is no concept of non - natural person  contesting election of the BOD in terms of Section 154 of the Act.   Learned counsel further argued that the re is nothing in the law which  bars a non - natural person from directing a natural person to offer  himself for election and then vote for such person in the election to be  conducted , meaning that it can give its proxy to a member.   In fact, it  appears to be  common practice for non - natural persons to transfer the  requisite shareholding in favour of persons it desires to contest  election  so that the requirement of Section 159(3) and Section 153  may be met   as   a ny such person who offers himself for election would   have to be a member in his own right.  Learned counsel  also  argued  ',\n",
       " '6   WP No. 27842 /2020   that a person offering himself for elections has to be a member and  there can be no exception to the same, therefore it is clear that there is  no concept of a non - natural person contesting  elections under the  applicable law.  Learned counsel argued that there is no concept of a   relation to a BOD of a company under the Act is persons being  nominated to a BOD directly without goi ng through the process of  elections under Sections 164 and 165 of the Act.     Preliminary Objections   8 .   Learned counsel for Respondent s   raised three preliminary  objections.   Firstly that  the Petitioner has appropriate, efficacious and  alternate remedy availab le to him under Section 160 of the Act ;   Secondly  that  the Petitioner  has no  locus standi   to  file the instant  Petition  as no fundamental right of the Petitioner has been infringed ;  Thirdly ,   Section 5(2) of the Act  is an ouster clause which ousts the  jurisdi ction  of this Court  specifically   on matters related to election of  directors which are to be dealt with exclusively by the Company  Bench of the High Court having jurisdiction.  Reliance is placed on   Muhammad Shafique Khan Sawati v. Federation of Pakistan et c .  ( 2015 SCMR 851 ),   Mian Javed Amir v. United Foam Industries  (Pvt.) Ltd. etc . ( 2016 SCMR 213 ) and  M. Fuwad A. Mughal v.  Federation of Pakistan etc . ( 2018 YLR 26 ).   9 .   With respect to the first objection that remedy under Section  160 of the Act is available   to the Petitioner who  seeks to  challenge the  eligibility of  eleven   candidates  named by  the Federal Government for  the purposes of election   to the BOD . Section 160 of the Act provides   that the Company Bench of the  relevant  High Court can   declare  the  electi on of directors invalid on an application of a member holding  10% of the voting power in the company  filed  within the  thirty  days  from the date of election ,   if there is material irregularity in  the  holding  of the elections and matters incidental or related   thereto. The  ',\n",
       " '7   WP No. 27842 /2020   contention is that the Petitioner does not have  locus standi   under  Section 160 of the Act as he does not have the requisite 10% of the  voting power.  S ince he does not qualify for the remedy under Section  160 of the Act, he cannot bypass the m andatory provisions of the  Act  and challenge  the  elections   through this Petition.  In this regard, it is   challenge  is specifically with the  decision  of the Federal Government to put up  eleven  candidates  for  the election  to the BO D of SNGPL on the ground that the Federal Government  cannot put up any candidates to par ticipate in the election of d irectors  and that   by doing so they are abusing their authority and acting in  error of law.   In this regard, it is noted that the entire disp ute is with  respect to  the  decision of the Federal Government to participate in the  elections. Since the decision and actions of the Federal Government  have been impugned before this Court, the instant Petition is  maintainable and this Court in constitutio nal jurisdiction can  determine whether or not  Federal  Government has acted in  accordance with law   or whether it has abused its authority.  In this  regard, it is noted that the powers under Section 160 vest ing   with the  Company  Bench of the  relevant  High  Cour t  is  the power  to determine  whether or not the elections   have been conducted   under the Act and  do es   not deal with the  judicial review of  actions   or decisions   of the  Federal  Government  challenged as interference  in  the election  process.   Section 160 of the A ct is a statutory right of a shareholder to  ensure that elections of directors  are conducted under the Act as  required and this provision is not available to the Petitioner to  challenge the actions of the Federal Government. Hence there is no  merit in this   objection.  So far as the issue of  locus standi   is concerned,  for the purposes of constitutional jurisdiction the Petitioner claims to  be aggrieved as he is a member of SNGPL and does not want the  Federal Government to usurp his rights as a member who want s to  contest elections for the BOD.   ',\n",
       " '8   WP No. 27842 /2020   10 .   With respect to the  third  objection  on the ouster of jurisdiction,  Section 5(2) of the Act  provides that  Notwithstanding anything  contained in any other law no civil court as provided in the Code of  Civil Procedure,  1908 or any other court shall have jurisdiction to  entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the  Court  is empowered to determine by or under this Act.  In terms of this  Section, the jurisdiction of  a  civil court or any other court   has  been  ousted to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter  which the court is empowered to determine by or under this Act.  Consequently Section 5(2) of the Act vests jurisdiction with the  Company Bench of the  relevant  High Court   to deal with  all matters  under the Act.  While interpreting  the ouster clause, the august  Supreme Court of Pakistan has in several cases held that the ouster  clause  has to be interpreted strictly and based on the  facts  of the case.  More specifically that the ouster clau se cannot be read or inferred to  oust constitutional jurisdiction.    11.   In  Allied Bank of Pakistan Ltd. v. Khalid Farooq   ( 1991 SCMR  599 ), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:   the exclusion  of jurisdiction of superior Courts is not to be  readily  inferred , that there is a strong leaning against any such exclusion,  that this rule is deep seated and if it is to be overtu r ned, it must  ordinarily be done by a clear, definite or positive provision, not left  to mere implication .      In  Munir Hussai n Bhatti, Advocate and others v. Federation of  Pakistan and another   ( PLD 2011 SC 407 ), the august Supreme Court  of Pakistan has held as under:   There   is  a vast body of precedent in our legal corpus which has   ay only be ousted  through express words in a legal text. This principle of law is by  now well settled.      In  Arshad Mehmood v. Commissioner/Delimitation Authority,  Gujranwala and others   ( PLD 2014 Lahore 221 ), it has been held   that :   ',\n",
       " '9   WP No. 27842 /2020   The ouster clause under S ection 10A of the Act  does not, in the slightest,  abridge or curtail the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court to judicially  review the orders, notifications and the acts of the executive i.e., the  Delimitation Authority and Delimitation Officer in thi s case.  It also  matters little if the ouster clause is considered to be a time specific clause,  as argued by some of the respondents. Courts usually give due weightage  to any administrative urgency of the Executive but this does not mean that  the doors lea ding to courts can be shut down as this would result in  curtailing and abridging the judicial power. This is opposed to  independence of judiciary  and the constitutional framework of separation  of powers.      As per  citations the ouster clause must be read in   the  context  of the   language  of the  statute . So far as constitutional jurisdiction  is  concerned, this Court will guard its jurisdiction  jealously  and  will not   oust its constitutional jurisdiction on inference   as Section 5(2)  of the  Act  does not explicitly  bar   .    12.   In  the instant case , the  ouster clause   specifically mention s   civil  courts or any other court to entertain suits or proceedings   in respect  of matters which the Company Bench of the High Court has  jurisdiction   by or  under  th e   Act, meaning thereby that  no other c o urt  can interfere in matters for which jurisdiction has been specifically  vested with the Company Bench of the  relevant  High Court .  Section 5  as the  ouster clause   does not protect unlawful actions and decisions   of  t he government  which are otherwise amenable to judicial review  under constitutional jurisdiction.  The  ouster clause   protects the  jurisdiction of the Company Bench of the relevant High Court to  ensure that no other  court impedes  on its jurisdiction.  The Comp any  Bench of the  relevant  High Court   under Section 160 of the Act can   consider  irregularities in the election of directors wherein the  requirements of the Act have not been followed or considered by it   but   cannot consider issues which go beyond irregularit ies under the  Act.   The  ouster clause   therefore does not cover decisions and actions  taken  by   the executive being the Federal Government   in this case .  More importantly  the application of Section 5 of the Act will not    in any manner  curb   the jurisdiction ves ted  in this    ',\n",
       " '10   WP No. 27842 /2020   Court  under Article 199 of the Constitution   as has been held in PLD  2014 Lahore 22( supra ).   Hence if an authority has acted in  contravention to the law or its authority or contrary to the principles of  natural justice, the same will be amenable   to writ jurisdiction and it  cannot be argued that such decisions will fall within the mandate of  Section 5(2) of the Act.  Importantly ,   t he objective of the  ouster clause   is to ensure that no other court will carry out parallel proceedings with  respect to  claims and complaints and issues specifically  arising  under  the scheme of the Act.  However, when an action is taken by the  Federal Government which is stated  to be  without jurisdiction or  authority  or is termed as misuse of power ,   tainted with malafide , th e  same will not fall within the  scope  of the  ouster clause   being Section  5(2) of the Act   or within the scope of Section 160 of the Act .    1 3 .   Respondent No.21, Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman relied upon order  dated 16.3.2020 passed in ICA No.14622/2020 to urge that  on account  of the status quo order, this Court cannot decide the issue of election  for the BOD  as a status quo order has been passed by a learned  Division Bench of this Court  in ICA No.14622/2020 . As per the  record and copy of the order produced before thi s Court, the matter in  issue in ICA No.14622/2020 is specifically with respect to the status  of Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman  i n the  outgoing  BOD    tenure ended on 22.6.2020. The order relied upon does not prevent  future election s   with respect to the  BOD of SNGPL  a s   any  determination made in the said ICA is with respect to the status of  Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman  i n   the previous  BOD   but not with respect to  the BOD  that is   to be elected ,   pursuant to the notice dated 2.5.2020 ,  hence there is no merit in this  objection.    Opinion of the Court   1 4 .   On 2.5.2020 in terms of Section 159 of the Act, the BOD  of  SNGPL  fixed the number of directors to be elected as  eleven  and  notified  the election to be held on 23.6.2020.

This  notice was also issued in the newspaper on  16.6.2020.  On 9.6.2020   the Govern ment of Pakistan , Ministry of Energy, Petroleum Division  informed SNGPL  of its   proposed  candidates  for  appointment of  directors by  election to the BOD.

The  dispute  before the Court is with respect to the  propos ed   names  of  the  Federal  Government  being the  candidates who  will  contest the election on  its  behalf. Out of  the eleven  names, three  candidates are members   where the dispu te is limited to whether they  can represent the Federal Government on the BOD as elected directors  and eight names are of non - members where the  dispute  is  whether a  non - member can contest the election while representing the Federal  ',\n",

The issue ,   before the Court is whether the Federal  Government can appoint directors through election under Section 159  of the Act and whether  it can propose  the names of  non - members to  contest the election on its behalf. The second issue is whether the  Federal Government is restricted to appoint nominee director under  Section s   164 and 165 of the Act, thereby prohibited from proposing  names of ca ndidates who will contest the election for the BOD on  its  behalf.    15.

       " '14   WP No. 27842 /2020   1 6 .   In terms of Section   153 of the Act certain persons are not  eligible to be directors of a company ,   where one  disqualification  is  that a person shall not be eligible to be appointed as director if  they  are   not a member   of the company .  Section 118 of the Act defines  member of a   company   being t he subscribers to the memorandum of  association  who are allotted shares and whose name is entered in the  register of members.  Section 154(2) of the Act also requires that only  a natural person can be a director. Hence to be a director a per son  must be a member and must be a natural person.   The Proviso to  Section 153(i) of the Act states that Section 153( i ) shall not apply in  the case of a person representing the member who is not a natural  person.  As per this Section in order to be eligible  as a director of a  company, the person must be a natural person and must be a member ,   h owever  an  exception  has been created  for  members ,   who are not  natural persons such as  corporate bodies or the Federal or Provincial  Governments   to  appoint a director on  their behalf .   They can appoint a  director who  is not a member   of the company .  So f o r the purposes of  the dispute before this Court, the Federal Government can appoint a  non - member as a director of SNGPL. Now the question is does  Section 153 apply to Sectio n 159 of the Act which is argued to be a  stand   alone   provision. Section 159 of the Act lays down   the procedure  for the election of directors whereby  any member   who seeks to contest  in  the election s   for  the BOD  is required to provide his notice of  intention   to offer him s elf  f or election as a director.  It has been argued  that under Section 159 of the Act  only member s   can participate in the  election of directors ,   that too a  member ,   who is a  natural person ,   because such  member  has to communicate  his intention t o offer  himself for election   as director, meaning thereby  that only a natural  person who is a  member   can offer  himself as a director of the  company   and cannot offer himself on behalf of anyone else .    ',\n",
       " '15   WP No. 27842 /2020   1 7 .   Under the Act, a director can be appointed under Sec tion 159 of  the Act being appointment through an election or under Section 164   and 165  being nominated directors of creditors or special interests by  virtue of contractual arrangements. Section 165 of the Act provides  that special interest directo r s are th ose who are nominated by  a  body  corporate or a company or any other entity   owned or controlled  directly or indirectly by the Federal Government or Provincial  Government on the  B oard of a company on account of any investment  made.  So  for the purposes of Sec tion 165 of the Act, t he contention of  the Petitioner  that the Federal Government can only appoint directors  through Section 165 of the Act as nominee directors is totally  misconceived   and against the mandate of the Act.  A shareholder of a  company enjoys c ertain rights of which the right to elect directors and  remove directors; the right to contest in the elections to the BOD and  the right to appoint proxy are relevant for the purposes of this case.  A  member of a company  by  virtue of holding shares in a com pany has  the right to participate in the decision making process either in their  capacity as shareholders or through the  BOD   based on their  shareholding.  For the purposes of meetings ,   Section 137 of the Act  provides that a member of a company is entitled t o attend and vote at  meetings of the company through a proxy. Section 138 of the Act  provides that  a body corporate or corporation which is the member of  a company can attend a meeting through an authorized representative  and exercise all powers  as member  through the authorized  representatives .  Section  139 of the Act provides that the Federal  Government as a member of the company can appoint any person it  deems fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the company or  meeting of class of members of  the company. Essentially these  sections enable a member to participate in the meetings either through  proxy or  through   an authorized representative.  The relevan ce   of these  sections for the purposes of a body corporate, corporation or in the  ',\n",
       " '16   WP No. 27842 /2020   context of the  Federal or Provincial Government where it is a member  of a company  i s  that  such members  who are not natural persons  will  act through  their  proxies or authorized representatives who are  exercising their right ,   in the meetings ,   to participate and to vote.  In   the  same context, since a member has the right to participate in the  election to the  BOD   of a company ,   where that member is not a natural  person  it   can exercise this right through proxy  or  through  its   representative s . The Petitioner  has essentially argued   that the Federal  Government  cannot   appoint elected directors on the B OD  and can  only appoint nominee directors on account of Section 159 of the Act.  His   understanding of Section 159 of the Act when read with Section  153 of the Act is totally flawed.  If ac cepted it would mean   that the  Federal Government  is  prohibited from exercising the basic right of a  member as given under Section 159 of the Act   to elect directors to the  BOD .  This is totally against the mandate of the Act. Section 159 of  the Act  also prov ides the procedure for holding elections of the BOD.   It cannot be read as prohibiting the right of certain members when it  comes to appointing directors.   In this context Section 153 (i)(i) clearly  provides that a director of a company must be a member of c ompany  except when such director is representing a member which is not a  natural person. The rationale behind Section 153(i)(i) of the Act is that  a body corporate or corporation and Federal or Provincial  Government ,   as the case may be ,   can  only  be represe nted on the BOD   through a  natural person  as  the body corporate or corporation  or  the  Federal or Provincial Government have to act through  their  representatives to attend meetings  to vote  or participate in the decision  making process .  In fact Section 15 3 (i )(i) of the Act gives the body  corporate or corporation and the Federal or Provincial Government  the additional right to consider appointing a member or a non - member  as its elected director under Section 159 of the Act.  It creates an  exception to the rule  that a person representing a member which is not  ',\n",
       " '17   WP No. 27842 /2020   a natural person, though not a member themselves qualify to be a  director.    1 8 .   In this context it  was   argued that the Federal Government ,   as a  member of SNGPL can only appoint a member as a director ,   specif ically because Section 159(3) of the Act requires a director to be  a member, who in his own capacity will give his consent to be  appointed as a director and gave his intimation to participate in the  elections. A plain reading of Section 159 (3)  makes it evi dent that the  provision  is procedural in nature which essentially lays down the  process to be followed for the purposes of election. Section 159(3) of  the Act requires  any member , be it a body corporate or the Federal or  Provincial Government, as the case  may be, give their consent and  intimation to offer themselves for election as directors. It goes without  saying that since the body corporate or the Federal or Provincial  Government will act through their representative who has to be a  natural person, they   will follow the process under Section 159(3) and  give their consent and intimation to the election.  Consequently  Section 159 (3)   of the Act does not prohibit the rights of non - natural  persons who are members  of a company  to appoint directors by  election   on   the BOD. Hence ,   t he Federal Government can appoint a  member or non - member as its candidate to participate in the election  for the BOD of Respondent No.3. In this regard, I have been informed  that the candidates mentioned at Serial No.1, 6, 13, 16 and 18 o f the  advertisement dated 16.6.2020 are non - members. Rest are all  admittedly members, out of which three are holding proxy of the  Federal Government, hence as such no illegality is made out on this  count.   19 .   The relevance of the right of a shareholder to  appoint a director  through election is best understood when seen in the context of the  difference between a nominee director and  an  elected director. A  nominee director is one who is appointed under Section 164 and 165  ',\n",

Section 164 of the Act provides that  in addition to director elected or deemed to have been elected by  shareholders, the company may have directors nominated by its  creditors or special  interests by virtue of a contractual arrangement. A  body corporate or corporation owned or controlled by the Federal or  Provincial Government may also nominate directors on the BOD to  such corporation or company that it has extended credit facilities. In  t he same manner Section 165 provides for the nomination of directors  representing special interests where the Federal or Provincial  Government as the case may be to nominate a director in a company  in which it has made some investments or on the basis of an y special  interests. A nominee director therefore is nominated by institutions  such as financial institutions or the Federal or Provincial Government  on the Board to protect its interests as nominator. The fundamental  difference between a nominee director  and elected director is that a  nomine director holds office at the pleasure of the nominator whereas  the elected director is given a three year tenure under the Act and  secondly that a nominee director has to safeguard the interests of its  nominator  first  and foremost  whereas an elected director has a  fiduciary duty to the company and  all  its shareholders. So the nominee  director participates in the proceedings of the BOD  as per the terms of  its arrangement with the nominator   inve stment or interest is safeguarded, to act as  a   liaison between the  nominator and the company and also in the larger picture  consider  the  overall policies  and working  of the company. In the instant case, the   nt can only act  through nominee directors under Section 165 of the Act,  notwithstanding the fact that they are members of SNGPL in their  own right, is contrary to the mandate of the Act.

       " '19   WP No. 27842 /2020   2 0 .   The Petitioner has also stated that the Federal Government has  vi olated the law laid down by this Court through judgment dated  27.2.2020 passed in WP No.21451/2019. This contention is also  totally misconceived. The issue before the Court in that case was that  whe ther   Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman  was a nominee director of the  F ederal Government or whether he contested the election in his own  capacity as a member of the company, hence the matter in issue is not  the same.  T o the extent of  Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman   who is  Respondent No.21 in this Petition, the court concluded that he w as  elected as a nominee of the Federal Government. The Court also  pointed out that there have been some irregularities in the manner in  which nominee directors of the Federal Government have not been  distinguished from the elected directors However this la pse does not  change the fundamental character of  Mian Misbah - ur - Rehman   who  was appointed as nominee director of the Federal Government. Hence  there has been no violation of this judgment. In fact it is the position  of the Federal Government that they have  been instructed by this  judgment and have attempted to remove those irregularities which led  to the dispute between the Federal Government, SNGPL and  Mian  Misbah - ur - Rehman .   2 1 .   Therefore t he Federal Government is a member  of SNGPL and  enjoys all rights of  a  member under the Act and can exercise all rights  as a member under the Act which includes  the  right to appoint and  remove directors under the Act.  This means that the Federal  Government can either appoint a director on the BOD through  elections  under Sec tion 159 of the Act  or through nomination under  Sections 164 and 165 of the Act.   2 2 .   In view of the aforesaid, no case for interference is made out.    The instant Petition is  dismissed   and the Respondent SNGPL  can  ',\n",

       " 'C.O \\nNo.\\n35 \\nof 20\\n06\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n71\\n \\nIn the case of s 459, the background \\nhas the following two features.  First, a \\ncompany is an association of persons for an \\neconomic purpose, usually entered into with \\nlegal advice and some degree of formality. \\n \\nThe terms of the association are contained in \\nthe articles of association and sometimes in \\ncollateral agreements between the \\nshareholders.  Thus the manner in which the \\naffairs of the company may be conducted is \\nclosely regulated by rules to which the \\nsha\\nreholders have agreed.  Secondly, company \\nlaw has developed seamlessly from the law of \\npartnership, which was treated by equity, like \\nthe Roman societas, as a contract of good \\nfaith.  One of the traditional roles of equity, \\nas a separate jurisdiction, was \\nto restrain the \\nexercise of strict legal rights in certain \\nrelationships in which it considered this \\nwould be contrary to good faith.  These \\nprinciples have, with appropriate \\nmodification, been carried over into company \\nlaw.\\n \\nThe  first of these two feature\\ns leads to \\nthe conclusion that a member of a company \\nwill not ordinarily be entitled to complain of \\nunfairness unless there has been some breach \\nof the terms on which he agreed that the \\naffairs of the company should be conducted.  \\nBut the second leads to t\\nhe conclusion that \\nthere will be cases in which equitable \\nconsiderations make it unfair for those \\nconducting the affairs of the company to rely \\n\\n \\n53\\n.\\n \\nAs stated above, the buy\\n-\\nout of shares is the \\nmost common remedy which is a\\nvailable to a \\npetitioner in a petition alleging unfairly prejudicial \\nconduct.

In Bird Precision Bellows Ltd (1984) \\nCh 419, Nourse J had the following comments to \\nmake with regard to the \\nrelevance \\n\\n \\nconduct:\\n \\n\\ncases where purchase orders are made under s \\n75 in relation to \\nquasi\\n-\\npartnerships the \\nvendor is unwilling in the sense that the sale \\nhas been forced upon him.  Usually he will be \\na minority shareholder whose interests have \\nbeen unfairly prejudiced by the manner in \\nwhich the affairs of the company have been \\nconducted b\\ny the majority.  On the \\nassumption that the unfair prejudice has made \\nit no longer tolerable for him to retain his \\ninterest in the company, a sale of his shares \\nwill invariably be his only practical way out \\nshort of a winding up.  In that kind of case it \\ns\\neems to me that it would not merely not be \\nfair, but most unfair, that he should be \\nbought out on the fictional basis applicable to \\na free election to sell his shares in accordance \\n\\nindeed on any other basis wh\\nich involved a \\ndiscounted price.  In my judgment the correct \\ncourse would be to fix the price pro rata \\naccording to the value of the shares as a whole \\nand without any discount, as being the only \\nfair method of compensating an unwilling \\nvendor of the equiva\\nlent of a partnership \\n\\npurchase of the shares of the delinquent \\nmajority, it would not merely not be fair, but \\nmost unfair, that they should receive a price \\n\\n \\n5\\n4\\n.\\n \\nThe date o\\nf valuation of shares is another \\nissue which will confront the Court making a buy\\n-\\nout order.  In Profinance Trust SA v Gladstone \\n(2002) 1 WLR 1024, it was held that:\\n \\n',\n",
       " 'C.O \\nNo.\\n35 \\nof 20\\n06\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n73\\n \\n\\nThe starting point should in our view \\nbe the general proposition stated by Nourse J \\nin In\\n \\nre London School of Electronic Ltd \\n\\nin a going concern ought to be valued at the \\n\\nThat is, as Nourse J said, subject to the \\noverriding requirement that the valuation\\n \\nshould be fair on the facts of the particular \\ncase.\\n \\nThe general trend of authority over the \\nlast 15 years appears to us to support that as \\nthe starting point, while recognising that there \\nare many cases in which fairness (to one side \\nor the other) require\\ns the court to take \\n\\n \\n5\\n5\\n.\\n \\nBut one of the classic statements on the value \\nto be put on the shares is found in Scottish Co\\n-\\noperative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer (1959) \\nAC 324 (House of Lords) in the words of Lord \\nDenning:\\n \\n\\nYour Lordships were \\nreferred to Bell \\nv Lever Bros Ltd, where Lord Blanesburgh \\nsaid that a director of one company was at \\nliberty to become a director also of a rival \\ncompany.

We may \\nalso make a reference to the observations \\non the \\nsubject made in \\n\\nModern Company Law\\n \\nSeventh Edition.  \\n \\nWhile \\ndiscussing the remedy under section 461 and the \\nwide remedial discretion of the Court to make such \\norder as it does have, it has been stated that:\\n \\n\\npurchase order gives the \\npetitioner an opportunity to exit from the \\ncompany with the fair value of his or her \\ninvestment, something which, in the absence \\nof a court order, is often not available to the \\nshareholder in a small company, because no \\npotential p\\nurchasers of the shares are available \\nor, even if they were, because of pre\\n-\\nemption \\nrights in the articles in favour of the other \\nshareholders, i.e. the controllers.\\n \\nThe crucial question in this buy\\n-\\nout \\nprocess is how is the court to assess the \\nfairness of\\n \\nthe price to be paid for the shares. \\nTwo important issues have emerged in the \\nvaluation process. The first is whether the \\n\\nrata to the total value of the company or \\nwhether its value should be discounted on th\\ne \\nbasis that it is ex hypothesi a minority holding \\nand so does not carry with it control of the \\ncompany. In Re Bird Precision Bellows Ltd it \\nwas established the principle was pro rata \\nvaluation because the buy\\n-\\nout had been \\nforced upon the minority by the u\\nnlawful acts \\nof the controllers. However, the court \\n',\n",
       " 'C.O \\nNo.\\n35 \\nof 20\\n06\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n75\\n \\n\\nnot been blameless, the value of the \\nshareholding might be discounted for its \\nminority status. Further, if the petitioner had \\nbought the shareholding at a pr\\nice which \\nreflected its minority status or it had devolved \\nupon him or her by operation of law, the full \\npro rata value might not be appropriate.\\n \\n\\nnormally override any provisions of the \\n\\n \\nat least \\nwhere they are less favourable to the minority.  \\nAt one time it was thought that the minority \\ncould, in effect, be forced to use the share\\n-\\npurchase and associated valuation provisions \\nin the articles, where they existed, on the \\ngrounds that an of\\nfer by the controllers to \\npurchase on the basis set out in the articles \\ndeprived their previous conduct of its quality \\nof unfair prejudice.  Although motivated by a \\nlaudable desire to encourage the parties to \\nsettle their differences without coming to \\ncour\\nt, the approach suffered from the fact \\nthat the articles often did not guarantee the \\nminority pro rata valuation.  It now seems to \\nhave been abandoned although an open offer \\non a pro rata basis, which would give the \\npetitioner all he could reasonably expec\\nt if the \\npetition were successful, will make it an abuse \\nof process for the petitioner to continue.\\n \\nThe second issue concerns timing.  The value \\nput on shares, whether on a pro rata or on a \\ndiscounted basis, will often crucially depend \\non when the value of\\n \\nthe company is assessed.  \\nThe courts have given themselves the widest \\ndiscretion to choose the most appropriate \\ndate.  The normally competing dates are a \\ndate close to when the shares are to be \\npurchased and the date when the petition was \\npresented.  In P\\nrofinance Trust SA v \\nGladstone, the Court of Appeal thought that \\nthe former had become the presumptive \\nvaluation date, but that there were many \\ncircumstances when an earlier date might be \\nchosen, for example, where the unfairly \\nprejudicial conduct had reco\\nnstructed its \\nbusiness or even that there had been a general \\n',\n",

The Law Commission \\nrecommended that that part should be added \\nto the range of remedies available to the court \\nfor the redress of unfair prejudice, but the \\nCLR rejected it on the grounds that it was \\nopen to abuse for the reasons discussed \\nbelow.  Nevertheless there is a separ\\nate \\nprocedure which a minority shareholder may \\nseek to use to have the company wound up.  \\nA company may be wound up compulsorily \\nby the court on a petition presented to it by a \\ncontributory if the court is of the opinion \\nthat it is just and equitable to do\\n \\nso.  This \\nprovision, now contained in s 122 (1)(g) of \\nthe Insolvency Act, 1986, has a long pedigree \\nin the law relating to companies, and the \\npower can be traced back to the Joint Stock \\nCompanies Winding up Act 1848.  The \\nprovision was influenced by the (\\nthen \\nuncodified) partnership law and was \\noriginally used mainly n cases where the \\ncompany was deadlocked.  In the course of \\nthis century it has been moulded by the courts \\ninto a means of subjecting small private \\ncompanies to equitable principles derived \\nfr\\nom partnership law then they wre in reality \\nincorporated partnerships.  As we have seen, \\nthe apotheosis of this use of the section, the \\ndecision of the House of Lords in Ebrahimi v \\nVestbourne Galleries Ltd, was highly \\ninfluential in the courts development \\nof their \\npowers under s 459.  Despite its remarkable \\nsubstantive development, the provision always \\nsuffered from a weakness at the remedial level: \\nif the company was prospering, presenting a \\n',\n",
       " 'C.O \\nNo.\\n35 \\nof 20\\n06\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n77\\n \\n\\nto killing the goose\\n \\nthat might lay the golden \\negg.  So long as the alternative remedy was \\nhobbled by the restrictive wording and \\ninterpretation of s 210 of the Companies Act \\n1948, the winding up petition was better than \\nnothing.  But, with the introduction of the \\nunfair prej\\nudice remedy, one may wonder \\nwhat its appropriate role in the scheme of \\nthings now is.  \\n \\nPt of the answer to this question lies in \\npurely tactical considerations on the part of \\nthe petitioners.  A winding up petitioner \\ntriggers s 127 of the Insolvency Act \\n1986, \\nwhich requires the courts consent for any \\n\\nthe petition is presented.  This ability to \\nparalyze or at least disrupt, the normal \\n\\nthe negotiating strength of the pet\\nitioner but \\nis hardly legitimate if a s 459 petition could \\ngive him or her all that is required.  \\nConsequently, a Practice Direction seeks to \\ndiscourage the routine joining of winding up \\npetitions to unfair prejudice claims, unless a \\nwinding up remedy is w\\nhat is genuinely \\nsought.  The force behind the Practice \\nDirection is provided by s 125(2) of the \\nInsolvency Act 1986, to the effect that the \\ncourt need not grant a winding up order if it \\nis of the opinion that some alternative remedy \\nis available to the pe\\ntitioners and that they \\nhave acted unreasonably is not pursuing it.  It \\nwould not seen an unreasonable use of this \\npower for the courts to insist that, where a \\nmore flexible s 459 remedy is available, the \\npetitioner should be confined to it.  That \\nwould be\\n \\na natural consequence of the fact \\nthat the statutory alternative to a winding up \\norder has finally come of age.  \\n \\nHowever, another part of the answer \\nlies in the long running controversy over \\nwhet4hr the grounds of unfairness upon \\nwhich a company can be w\\nound up under s \\n122 (1)(g) of the 1986 Act are wider than \\nthose which will found an unfair prejudice \\nremedy under s 459 of the 1985 Act.

M. Akbar  Maggo   bid  for the 2%  shareholding in 2005 in his personal capacity and  transferred the shares in his name in the register of  members.

The learned   counsel for  the petitioners states that the bid for the 2% shares  was made by M. Akbar  Maggo   surreptitiously and  without  taking  the petitioners  on board .   According  to him, this could not have been done without the  approval of the petitioners and could on ly have been  achieved jointly as the shares were to be purchased  in the name of the petitioners as well as the  respondents and were to be allotted to them  according to their  current  shareholding.

Akbar and Associates @ Rs.70  per share.   Further, according to the learned counsel,  the shares were not transferred in the name of M.  Akbar   Maggo   strictly by following the mandate of  law and thus any such transfer is void.  He has relied  upon section 178 of the Ordinance, 1984 to  contend that any transfer of shares has to have the  approval of the Board of Directors.  The basis of the  learned   which permeated the relationship  between the  shareholders according to which parity had to be  maintained and this has been breached by M.

As  explicated, the  learned counsel relied upon section 76 and 77 for  the proposition that a transfer of shares has to have  the approval of the Board of Directors and on this  basis it is asserted that the transfer was  illegal and  done in a cl andestine manner.   7.

Since the  learned counsel for the petitioners does not rely  upon a written agreement in this regard, the  question, therefore, is in the  realm  of disput e d ,  controversial and competing set of facts for which  evidence is required.   It is pertinent to mention that  one of the reliefs prayed for in the instant petition is  for this Court to   d irect that half of the shares  unlawfully acquired by the Respondent N os. 2 to 7  from the Ghee Corporation of Pakistan in October  2005 be transferred to the Petitioners    This is a prayer which merely requires that  half of the shares be transferred to the petitioners.

It is  denied by the learned counsel for the respondents  that any Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU )   or an agreement or any other document was  executed on which the relationship was formalized  between the parties.  According to him, it is a me re  name and cannot be termed as a formal legal entity  and comprised of sponsors of the Company or their  successors.  This, according to him, was a condition  of privatization and could not be deviated from.  He  submits that the petitioners No.1  and 3 were n ever   part of the actual bidding in the year 1992 and thus  the assertion that there were two  separate  groups is a  mere  delusion  and is divorced  from  reality.   Learned  counsel submits that there was only one group and  that comprised of the successors of the   original  sponsors.

In order to  embark upon a determination of  the 2% shareholding, which   is the bone of  contention between the parties, it would be  necessary as a first step to ascertain the nature of  M.Akbar  Maggo   and Associates.  The learned  counsel for the respondents No.1 to 7 has placed on  record in the shape of book No.1 various  documen ts in order to demonstrate that the  petitioners No.1  and 3  were not part of  the  company  at any stage.  In this regard, a pedigree  table has been produced which is not in dispute  between the parties.  According to this   table , there  were t wo brothers in the  first place,  Hameed  Maggo   and Hanif  Maggo , from whom the progeny  descended .  Both Hameed  Maggo   and Hanif  Maggo  died and the wife of Hameed  Maggo , Begum  Perveen  Maggo  is the petitioner No.2 whereas  Sultana Tajammul Chaudhry, the daughter of  Hameed  Maggo  is  the petitioner No.4.

According to the pedigree table, the petitioner No.1  is not part of  Maggo  family and is the brother of the  wife of respondent No.2 whereas the petitioner  No.3 is the wife of petitioner No.1.  The first  docum ent in the line of documents, produced by the  learned counsel for the respondent No.1 to 7, is a  bidding document for UIL submitted to the  Privatization Commission.  It does not contain the  names of the petitioners No.1 and 3.  This,  according to the learn ed counsel for the respondents,  is the  composition of M.

The sale agreement dated 21.05. 1992 ,  executed between Ghee Corporation of Pakistan  through the Privatization Commissio n is also  executed with Mian M. Akbar  Maggo  and  Associates.  This according to him has been signed  on behalf of M. Akbar  Maggo  and Associates by  Mian M.  Akbar   Maggo .  The learned counsel has  then referred to the Form XXIX dated 17.2.1992 of  Oil Trade (Pvt. ) Ltd. of which the respondents were  directors.

These documents, according to the learned counsel,  bring home the ineluctable fact that M.  Akbar   Maggo  and Associates was one group, comprising of  the successors of the original sponsors of the  petitioner No.1 and 3 were not part of it.   10.   From the facts adumbrated, it is evident that  the learned counsel for the petitioners has not been  able to place on record a document of  unimpeachable character which will establish that  there were in fact two groups which conjoined  together  to  bid for   the shares of UIL from  Privatization   Commission.  M.  Akbar   Maggo  and  Associates comprising of certain individuals who  claim to be the successors of original sponsors  seems  to be the only group vying for shares from GCP  and  whose  names can be ascertained f rom the bidding  document placed before the Privatization  Commission in the year 1992.  It is difficult  therefore to hold that there were two groups and  that there was an understanding with regard to the  transfer of shareholding between those two groups.   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         12   A s stated above, this is a controversy which cannot  be resolved in the summary jurisdiction of this  Court.   11.   The entire foundation of the learned counsel  for the petitioners for the setting aside the allotment  of 2% of shareholding in the name  of M.  Akbar   Maggo  is based on the premise that there existed an  oral  agreement between the parties for the allotment  of shares in certain ratio which were divested by the  Privatization Commission.  Since no formal  agreement has been produced in order to establish   the   fact  it is otiose to assert that 2% shareholding  ought to be distributed in like manner and on the  basis of earlier shareholding.   On a parity of  reasoning, and conversely, it could be argued by the  respondents that any such agreement came to an end  or wa s modified, at a later stage though the  arrangement is vouched by the history of share  allocations.  In short, the claims and its rebuttal can  only be brought home by evidence pro and contra,  and not otherwise.   The learned counsel for the  petitioners subm itted that the transfer could not  have taken place without the appro val of the board  of directors.  According to the learned counsel for  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         13   the respondents, there was no requirement for the  shareholding to be transferred with the approval of  the board of direc tors   as,  the transfer has already  taken place and the register of members now  includes the transferred shareholding  of 2%  in the  name of M.  Akbar   Maggo .   12.   As   adumbrated, no shareholding agreement  has been placed on record for the allotment of  shareholdin g on  proportionate  basis to the  petitioners as well as the respondents.  Also no  condition has been shown in the privatization  agreement o f   21.5.1992 for the  acquisition or  subsequent sale of 2% shares on  that  basis.  The  shares were held by the Ghee Corpo ration which  was the exclusive owner and which could sell  without any restriction or condition and ostensibl y  no  exception can be taken to the sale of the shares  by the Ghee Corporation to any person or a group  of persons.   If this were the case, a challen ge could  be laid to the privatization process and divesting of  the shares by the Ghee Corporation which has not  been done by the petitioners and a prayer in the  instant petition for  allocation  of half of its shares to  the petitioners in fact goes to the ro ot of the  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         14   divestment  made by the Ghee Corporation which  ought to be set aside in the first instance so as to  clothe the petitioners with any right to the allotment  of  those  shares.   According to the record, an  independent agreement of sale was made with th e  respondent No.2 in terms of which the 2%  shareholding was divested in favour of the  respondent No.2 in lieu of price which was made  over  by the respondent No.2 admittedly.   13.   There are two facets to the challenge to 2%  shareholding by the petitioners.   One part of the  challenge attac k s the legality of M. Akbar  Maggo   to  acquire those shares alone from GCP to the  exclusion of the petitioners.  This is premised on   authorised M. Akbar  Maggo   to bid on behalf of all   the parties, including the petitioners.  That  agreement has not been produced on record with the  petition.   T he petition alludes to and makes a   (para 2) but no document is forthcoming in this  regard.  Aga in, in paragraph 12, the petitioners state  that:   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         15    It is submitted that as of right the offer of GCP  Shares should have been communicated to the  Petitioner Shareholders by Respondent No.2 so  as to allow the Petitioners an opportunity to  acquire a proportion   equal to their original  shareholding (50%) out of these shares.  It is  submitted that the Petitioner Shareholders were  and are entitled to 50% of the GCP Shares and  are ready and willing to acquire their entitlement  upon payment of the sale consideration  due.   The action of the Respondent Nos. 2 to 7 in  seeking to exclude the Petitioners from the  acquisition of their entitlement in these shares is  unlawful and amounts to gross bad faith.    14.   This can hardly form a ground for staking a  claim to GCP shares   claim is based on a purported historical  understanding reached in the year 1992.  That is not  in issue in this petition.   That has come to  p ass.   What is in issue is whether there was an agreement  to acquire 2% shares by t he parties in proportion  equal to their original shareholding in the year 2005.   As adumbrated, no document evidences such an  alleged agreement and this makes the case one of  further enquiry  eminently fit for a regular trial and  outside the summary jurisdi ction of this Court.    The  onus was on the petitioners to prove an agreement  to exist in respect of 2% shareholding.  Certainly,  the divestment was not made in vacuum by GCP nor  is it the case of the petitioners that the procedural  formalities had gone abeg ging.  By the year 2005,  the relations between the parties, as per the  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         16    there was a gaping trust deficit amongst them.  It  is  thus incredulous to think that the petitioners still  held the belief that the res pondent No.2 would act  on their behalf too, honestly and diligently.  The  petitioners were certainly guilty of naivety if nothing  else.   15.   The second facet of the challenge relates to  the transfer of shares (2%) in the name of  respondent No.2 in the Regis ter of members  without the approval of the board of directors: The  learned counsel for the petitioners invo k es the  provisions of section 76 and section 193 to canvass  the proposition that the approval of the board to  transfer the shares is a  sine qua non .   16.   Firstly, the challenge on this basis revolves  around the plea of illegality to have pervaded the  transaction and thus  that  the waters were sullied  from the very inception.  If, as held above, that plea  has gone abegging for want of proof,  the rest of t he  challenge must fall too.  The respondents have  retorted that all procedural formalities were met in  making the transfers.  SECP in its reply vouches that   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         17   the transfer of 2% shares in the name of respo ndent  No.2.  A holistic reading of the petition would bring  forth that no frontal attack has been made to the  transfers on the ground of lack of approval by the  board.  In paragraph 17, however, a reference has   val in  authorizing the sale of shares in the name of M.  Akbar Maggo.   17.   A word regarding the assertion by the learned  counsel as to the lack of approval by the directors.   This is a nuanced  argument  and does not take into  consideration the various busines ses of the company  and fails to distinguish between day to day affairs of  the company and the business to be transacted by  the directors in terms of section 196.  The theme of  the law is that where duties are cast upon the  directors, a  specific mention has   been made  as  in  sections 233, 234 and 234  which  are  cited  as  an  illustration.  These provisions cast a duty on the  directors and lay a penalty for non compliance.   Section 76 does no such thing.  It is a ministerial act  to be performed by the officers of  the company.   The provision addresses the company and not the  directors.  We will bear in mind that the directors  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         18   are only obliged to meet once in a quarter of a year  (s. 193(2)) and no more.  Also the enumerated  powers are given in section 196 and that do es not  include the specific power to approve the transfer of  shares.  It ineluctably follows that an approval by the  board is not a necessary precondition to a valid  transfer and no illegality would afflict the said  transfer on this basis alone.    The only  requirement is  that the deed of transfer be lodged with the  company for the deed shall not have any effect so as  to put the transferee into the position of the transfer  until it has been lodged with the company and  accepted by it.  Until the lodgment, the  transfer shall  be effective between the transfer and the transferee  and nothing detracts from that fact.  The  registration of the transfer in the register of  members makes the transferee a shareholder in the  full and true sense of the term with all the rig hts of a  shareholder.  The mutation in the register of  members is a ministerial and clerical act.  The board  of directors will only be called upon to act in the  case of subsection (2) where the transfer deed is lost  or mutilated and the directors have to b e satisfied  before any transfer is effected and approved.

If it   i s the former, then a separate petition under  section 152 of the Ordinance, 1984 ought to have  been filed in order to lend seriousness to the  challenge.  In the latter case, an alleged fraudulent  transfer of shareholding has n ever   been con sidered a  bona fide   and valid ground for seeking a winding up  order.  Two judgments viz.

The learned counsel  submits that the letter of 1.4.2006 written on behalf  of the company to the petitioner No.1 has been  quoted  out of context.  He has referred to a letter of  25.3.20 06 to contend that in fact the letter at page  334 dated 01.04.2006 is a reply to the letter dated  25.3.2006 by which  copy of the  minutes of the  meeting of the board of directors for authorizing to  purchase 10% shares through GCP was required to  be given to   the petitioner No.1.   2 3 .   With regard to the assertion of deadlock, the   arguments is that it is not an inviolable rule that  where a deadlock is pleaded that a company ought  to be wound up inevitably.  The lea rned counsel  submits that in fact there is no deadlock and the  instances of deadlock are not  particularized .  He has  referred  copiously  to various documents to state that  throughout the period till the filing of the petition,  all the directors were paid sa laries and the audited  accounts of the company were duly filed with the  approvals of the directors in the meeting of the  board of directors.  The learned counsel submits  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         25   that certain events triggered the filing of the instant  petition and he has referred t o the reasons which  formed the  backdrop  for the dispute in question.   All of these documents have been filed in the form  of paper book No.7.  Therefore, the petitioners had  a motive to come to this Court and the instant  petition has not been filed  bona   fid e .  The following  spate of litigation has been referred in order to  bolster the argument of malice by the learned  counsel for the respondents:       son  Khurram Maggo against the petitioners No.2  and 4.      The wife of respo ndent No.2 was deprived of  a shareholding in the company by the  petitioner No.1 (brother of respondent No.2)  and, therefore, the respondent No.2 was  constrained to file an application under  section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure  against the judgment  and decree dated  08.12.2003 which is at page 97 and 99 of the  book No.7.  She also filed an application  under section 152  of the Ordinance, 1984  which is pending as C.O No. 52 of 2006.    2 4 .   A reference has been made to the documents  annexed with this petiti on.  Audited accounts,  according to the learned counsel, have been  ',\n",

Sinc e the  petitioners were directors, they approved the audited  accounts and cannot be heard to say otherwise.   They are, therefore, responsible for the submission  of the audited accounts in any case in terms of  section 241 of the Ordinance, 1984.  Various  min utes of the meeting have been perused which  betray  the active participation of the petitioners in  the company affairs and Forms XXIX have also  been annexed.  In book No.8, evidence of the  salaries which were paid to the working directors has  been attached.    On 30.04.1998, 16.04.2003 and  23.6.2003 rights issue were made and the petitioners  were beneficiar ies  of those rights issue.  Further,  documents have been referred to  which bear  the  signatures of the petitioner No.1 whereby he made  financial disbursement s as also that the petitioner  No.1 took care of the income tax affairs of the  company which were exclusively being dealt with by  him.  He also claimed refunds etc. from the  department on behalf of the company.   These have  ',\n",

Further, the petitioner No.1 was authorized to  initiate and conduct litigation on behalf of the  company and he continued to do so up till March,  2006 i.e.  just  before the filing of the instant petition.   2 5 .   In a nub, the learned counsel  for the  respondents has made a frontal rather than flanking  attack on the  motives  and  conduct of the petitioners  and has cast serious doubt  regarding  fairness   of these  proceedings .  According to the learned counsel, the  conduct has not been in the interest   of the company.   In this regard, he has referred to various proceedings  taken by the petitioner after filing of the instant  petition.  It is not necessary to refer to that part of  the litigation which is still subjudice between the  parties.  It is the cas e of the respondents that there is  absolutely no deadlock between the directors or at  least till the filing of the petitioner and this petition  is motivated by  unlawful  motives and has been  brought about in order to extract illegal gains.   2 6 .   As adumbrated , the entire reliance of the  learned counsel for the petitioners in support of the  plea for the company to be wound up is on the basis  of a deadlock which has come to exist between two  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         28   groups of directors ,   four  each  in number ,   and which  has  brought the fun ctioning of the company  to a  grinding halt  and has rendered its operation  to be  conducted in a  smooth and transparent manner as  impracticable.     This, according to the learned  counsel for the petitioners, is a sufficient ground for  the ordering of the comp any to be wound up as  there is no alternative under the circumstances and  to his aid the learned counsel has invoked the  ratio  decidendi   settled in the Lad l i Pr a sad case referred to  above.   It would, therefore, be appropriate at this  stage to dissect the  s tructure of  Lad l i   Prasad  case  and  its relevance  and applicability to the facts of the  instant case.   2 7 .   However, before I proceed to discuss  Ladi   case, a reference may be made to certain intervening  events which took place during the course of the  proceedi ngs before this Court.  A s   a backdrop   it  may be stated that from the facts and circumstances  brought forth, it   is evident that acrimony and lac k of  trust has marred the relationship of the directors  inter se.  This may not precisely be the case for the  sub stantial period of the functioning of the company  since its privatization in the year 1992 but certainly  ',\n",

This is  evident from the suit filed by Jahangir  Mag go  against the petitioners No.2 and 4.  Litigation  also  ensued after the shares of Tehmina Maggo were got  transferred by the petitioner No.1 and the last nail  in the coffin was the transfer of 2% shareholding in  the name of M. Akbar Maggo .  During the cour se of  the proceedings by this Court, local commission was  appointed to take into custody the record of the  company and to prepare an inventory.  This was  perhaps necessitated in order to gauge the financial  and economic affairs of the company.  This is  ref lected in the order dated 4.7.2006.  This also  finds mention in the order dated 23.6.2006 and the  report submitted in this regard by the local  commission.   At one stage, the election of the  directors was also held under the  auspices  of this  Court and it is   evident from the order dated  20.04.2007.  Since the parties were at loggerhead  with regard to the payment of dividends as is evident  from the order dated 20.06.2008, this Court  directed the payment of certain sum of Rs.120  million as dividends to both the   parties in equa l  ',\n",

By order dated 19.4.2010 a  status  quo   order was passed by the agreement of parties  with regard to the fixation of th e number of the  directors of the company for the purpose of election  for the next term of three years.   2 8 .   Now we come to the order dated 27.6.2011 .   The learned counsel for the respondents No.1 to 7  and other respondents have addressed their  arguments by  making this order as the  central  point.   It is the peg on which their case hangs.   According  to the learned counsel for the respondents, the order  of 27.6.2011 should alley  any  doubts regarding the  intention of the parties  which can clearly be culled  out f rom this order.  This, according to the learned  counsel, is the harbinger  of the future course of  action agreed to by the parties and must form the  foundation for the decision of this petition.   The  said order is reproduced  in extenso   for facility:    The pa rties have reached a consensus that a  Chartered Accountant be appointed by the Court  to determine as of 30 th   June, 2011, the break - up  value of the shares of the respondent - Company,  United Industries Ltd., on the basis of the  current/fair market value of th e shares.  In this  regard, it has also been agreed that:   ',\n",

Accordingly, the learned Local  Commission shall be paid arrears of  remune ration on the aforesaid basis within a  fortnight.   4.   Learned counsel for the petitioners has  pointed out that till the value of the shares is  determined, it would be expedient that a neutral  person is appointed to run the affairs of the  company so that the   job of the Chartered  Accountant is  facilitated .

       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         32   the next date of hearing, which is fixed for     2 9 .   It is clear from a reading of the order,  reproduced above, that upon a consen sus reached  by  the parties, a Chartered Accountant was appointed  by the Court to determine as of 30.06.2011 the  breakup value of the shares of UIL.   For the  purpose, certain factors were delineated in the order  to be taken into account by the Chartered  Acc ountant for the purposes of calculating the  breakup value of the shares.  The Chartered  Accountant was required to submit his report before  31.07.2011.  It is clear in my mind that by the said  order, the Chartered Accountant was appointed  exclusively for t he purposes of determination of the  breakup value of the shares of the UIL and no more,  no less.   In the course of the determination, the  auditor was  also  required to audit the accounts of  the company from 01.07.2006 to 30.06.2011.  The  said audit has been   conducted by the auditor and the  learned counsel for the petitioners has heavily relied  upon these reports to submit that the auditor has  brought forth  serious instances of mismanagement  and pilferage in the accounts of the company.  This  aspect will be d ealt with in the latter part of this  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         33   judgment.  Suffice to say that for the present  purposes, the order  had a limited scope and was  for  the purposes of the  calculation  of the breakup value  of the shares of UIL and must be taken as such.   This order has bee n signed on the margins by the  parties and their respective learned counsel s   as a  token of its  correctness .     30 .   It is very difficult to construe the clear  intention behind the passing of the said order as it  cannot be ascertained with any degree of exact itude  upon a reading of the order.  Certainly, it does  mention that a Chartered Accountant was being  appointed upon  consensus of the parties to  determine the breakup value of the shares of the  company.  However, it does not spell out clearly  whether the co nsensus extended beyond the  determination of the breakup value of the shares and  what was the next course to be followed  upon  such  determination made by the Chartered Accountant.   Therefore, any consensus reached  by  the parties is  lacking in material parti culars as to the conclusion of  the entire exercise.  However, one thing is certain.   That the parties were  embarked on  a course of  action by which an offer could be made on the basis  ',\n",

The statement made by the learned counsel for the  petitioners at the fag  end  of his arguments certainly  lends credence to this aspect.  This order in my  opinion was not passed withou t reason and must be  given the proper place that it deserves in the entire  setting of the litigation between the parties.  Clearly,  it was an agreement  under the auspices of this Court .   By  necessary  inference also it reflects the intent of  the parties tha t a winding up was not an option in  the contemplation of the parties any more.  This  begs the question; to what avail was the entire  exercise if it were to come to a naught and to result  in a waste of judicial resources and the fee expanded  on the work acc omplished by the Chartered  Accountant.  I may make a reference to the order  dated 15.9.2011 in this regard by which the learned  counsel s   submitted and informed the Court that  efforts for an amicable settlements between the  parties  were  still in progress an d that there  were  good prospect s   that such a settlement shall be  reached in due course.

A reference to order dated  01.07.2011 may also be made by which certain  amount was distribut ed as dividend equally between  the parties.  By that order, the parties agreed that M.

To complete the narration  with regard to the settlement of disputes between  the parties, an MOU was signed between   the parties  which has been filed by the petitio ners through C.M  No.642 of 2015.  F or the present purposes, suffice  to say that the MOU is another  in stance which  contributes to the  inference drawn  that the parties  had realigned their focus to be other than   winding  up of the company.    Ladli Prasad Case :   3 1 .   Ladli Prasad Case is at the forefront of the  arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the  petitioners.  This case was at the heart of the entire  proposition built by the petitioners.  Ladli Prasad  ca se  has been  quoted  more often than not as a  binding precedent in support of the proposition that  where there is an impasse and a deadlock between  the shareholders of a company, it is just and  equitable that the company be wound up.  However,  Ladli Prasad c ase must find a permanent  resting  place in the  commercial jurisprudence  of this  country.   Like any other case, it is an authority for  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         37   its own facts and must be considered in that context.   It cannot be applied generally and across the board  to the facts of   every case that comes up for the  winding up of a company on the ground that the  directors or  shareholders   had  locked  horns  and the  dispute amongst them has crippled the functioning  of the company.  In a recent case, C.O No.45 of  2004 Hafiz Abdul Rehman et c. v. Hafiz Abdul  Majeed etc, the applicability of Ladli Prasad case has  been analyzed in the following manner:    5.   During the course of arguments, it became  apparent that the principles propounded in Ladli   f  this case. The oft repeated passage from the said  judgment reads as follows.    company the tendency of the Courts has  uniformly been to treat it more or less as a  partnership and to apply the same  principles in the wi nding up of a private  limited company as would entitle a  partner to have a partnership dissolved.  Commonly the exclusion of partner from  the management of the firm, the existence  of a state of deadlock between the  partners or the justifiable lack of  confid ence in the management have been  regarded as just and proper grounds for     The petitioners were admittedly at all  material times minority shareholders and as such  there was no deadlock of management in  respondent No.1 c ompany and none was  established through affidavits or documents. It is  not the ratio of Ladli Prasad that every time a  dispute arises between the shareholders of a  private limited company and a shareholder or a  set of shareholders are excluded from the  man agement of the company, the Court has no  option but to order the winding up of the  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         38   company. On the contrary, in order for the ratio  of Ladli Prasad to be attracted to a case, the  dispute between the shareholders/directors of a  private limited company ought   to be of such a  nature that it becomes virtually impossible to  smoothly run the affairs of the company. It may  be pointed out that the facts of Ladli Prasad were  that through a resolution it was mandated that all  the decisions were to be taken unanimously   by  the directors who had equal shareholding and the  purpose of such resolution was explained in the   branches equal shares and equal voice in the  management of the business which could  henceforward be run only with  the assent of all  the three branches. No meeting could be held  unless all the three directors were present and no  decision was to be valid unless it was passed by    present  case where the petitioner is a minority  shareholder and there was never any arrangement  between the parties for sharing management of  respondent No.1 company.   6.   In the case of Kruddson Limited, Karachi  PLD 1972 Karachi 376 , wherein the minority  sh areholders had presented a winding up petition  which ultimately failed to find favour with the   held as follows.      Neither in principle, therefore, not  on authority, am I persuaded that a  private limited   company is required to be  wound up whenever a shareholder wises  that it should be, as would be the case in a  partnership at will when one of the  partners desires the dissolution of the  firm. If that had been the intention of the  Legislature nothing would  have been  simpler than to have provided that a  private limited company is to be wound  up upon notice to that effect being given  by any shareholder or to have used other  language comparable to the provisions of  section 43 of the partnership Act.   15.   In none   of the cases to which I  have referred was an order of winding up  made on the ground, simpliciter, that one  of the shareholders desired such an order.  In each of them there was a ground such  as a deadlock in the management, a  justified lack of confidence i n those who  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         39   were managing the Company or conduct  on their part calculated to deprive a  minority of their due share in the profits  or management of the Company. Indeed,  in some case, a winding up order was  refused when grounds were urged which  did not, in t he opinion of the Court,  made it just and equitable to wind up the  Company; obviously in these cases if the  wishes of the petitioning shareholders  sufficed, an order of winding up would  have been made.  I think that the true  position is that a private limit ed company  is to be treated as a partnership firm in  the sense only that such circumstances as  would justify the dissolution of the firm  under section 44 of the Partnership Act  on the ground that it was just and  equitable to order a firm to be dissolved  wo uld also justify the winding up of a  private Company . In the Supreme Court  case of Ladli Prasad, for example, each of  the three directors had equal voting power  in the company and decisions were to be  taken only unanimously, in these  circumstances, the res olution purporting  to remove one of them was held to be  illegal and relations between the three  were found to be so embittered that there   supplied)   The above passage makes it  clear that even when  shareholders of a private  l imited company are in  dispute and a winding up  petition is presented on the   case, the only consideration  that ought to weigh with  the Court is whether it is  just and equitable to wind  up the company.    3 2 .   Let me now proceed to  ana lyse  the factual  basis of the Ladli Prasad case.  The case relate d   to  Karnal Distillery Co., Ltd. which was converted into  a private limited company on 23 rd   of March, 1941,  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         40   from a partnership firm.  From July, 1941 onward,  differences arose between the app ellant in that case  and other directors.   A spate of litigation  ensued  between the directors where suit was filed by one set  of directors and Ladli Prasad, the appellant  retaliated by filing a suit for declaration of his own.   During the pendency of the li tigation, a compromise  was effected between the parties and one of the  planks  of the compromise was that henceforth  all  resolutions, whether of a general meeting or of the  directors were to be passed unanimously.   As a result  of the compromise, a general m eeting of the  company was held on 16.10.1945 and one of the  resolutions passed in that meeting was that all  decisions must be taken at a meeting of the directors  unanimously.  Further, that no meeting could be  held unless all the three directors were prese nt and  any decision was to be  in valid unless it was passed  by all the directors.   The case of the appellant Ladli  Prasad was that the terms of the compromise were  breached by the other set of directors and meetings  were held without notice to the appellant   and certain  acts were performed which adversely affected the  status of the appellant as a director.  Thereupon, the  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         41   appellant filed a petition for winding up on 1 st   of  May, 1946.  The learned Single Judge of the High  Court at Lahore came to the conclusion   that there  was a deadlock in the affairs of the company as the  relations between the parties had deteriorated to  such an extent that they could  not  possibly agree to  anything.  A winding up order was accordingly made  on 26 th   of January, 1955.  A Letters P atent Appeal  was filed and a Division Bench of the High Court  reversed the decision of the Single Judge.  While  doing so, reliance was placed on a new section 153 - C, introduced in 1951 in India in the Companies  Act, 1913.   This provision enabled the Courts   in  India to make appropriate orders for putting an end  to dispute between the shareholders of a company  without putting an end to the company itself.  The  question, therefore, before the Supreme Court of  Pakistan was whether Letter s   Patent  Bench was right   in taking a view that it was not just and equitable to  order the winding up of the company in  the  facts  and circumstances of the case.   An important  observation  by the Supreme Court of Pakistan  which will impact the determination of this petition  as well  was that:   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         42    We are unable to accept this contention,  firstly, because the rights of the parties in this  matter  are to be adjudged according to the legal  position prevailing on the date of the institution  of the proceedings for winding up and not on the  bas is of changes which have since been  introduced without the consent of the appellant  pendente lite by the unilateral acts of the      3 3 .   It was emphasized that the real reason for the  holding by the learned Single Judge that it was  just  and equitable t o wind up the company was that the  constitution of the company required that the  business should be carried on with the consent of all.   This, in the estimation of the learned Single Judge,  was impossible to attain as the relations between the  parties had  become so bitter that they could not  possibly carry on the business jointly.   3 4 .   The Letters Patent Bench, however, was  influenced in its findings by the amendment brought  about in India in 1951 by the insertion of section  153 - C.  The Supreme Court of Paki stan while  rejecting the basis of the Letters Patent Bench  observed that that section had not been inserted in  the Pakistani law and, therefore, could not be used  for the determination of the rights of the parties in a  winding up petition.  In other words,   the powers  given by section 153 - C in India were found to be  inapplicable in the context of Pakistani law.  It was  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         43   further  held that in any case, section 153 - C merely  gave an alternative remedy to a member of a  company to apply to the Court for making the  kind  of order mentioned therein in support of winding  up of a company.  It  gives no power to the Court to  suo motu   resort to exercise the powers mentioned  therein.   In the circumstances, therefore, it was held  that the petition for winding up was either to   be  allowed or rejected and there was no third course  open to the courts in Pakistan.  The Supreme Court  of Pakistan thereafter proceeded to consider the  facts of the case and to hold that the subsequent  conduct of the other co - directors of the appellant  l eft no room  for  doubt that feelings had become so  em bitter ed   that reconcilia tion was well - nigh  impossible.   3 5 .   From the facts brought forth above, it is clear  that the issues and controversy involved in Ladli  Prasad case was materially different from the c ase in  hand.  Much water has flowed under the bridge  since Ladli Prasad case and there is a sea - change in  the law relating to companies by the insertion of  sections 314   (2)   and 290 of the Ordinance, 1984.   These provisions were not found in the Act of 1913   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         44   and thus there can be no  parallels  which can be  drawn in terms of the legal setting obtain ing  at the  time of the decision of Ladli Prasad case and under  the present dispensation.  A comparison of the  provisions of the Act, 1913 and the Ordinance,  1984 wou ld reveal that section 290 has been  introduced by the legislature with the purpose of  prevention of  oppression and mismanagement.  It  specifically applies to a situation where the Court is  of the opinion that to wind up the company would  unfairly  prejudice   the members or creditors.  Part X  of the Ordinance, 1984 has been newly added and  does not find any comparable provisions in the Act,  1913.   It  confers powers on the Court to make  certain orders with a view to bringing to an end the  matters complained of  and for regulating the  conduct of the   affairs in future.  It also  includes the power in the Court to order  for the  purchase of the shares of any members of the  company by other members of the company or by  the company.  It may be recalled that th e instant  petition is also a petition under section 290 of the  Ordinance, 1984 and makes an alternate prayer in  case the prayer for the winding up of the company is  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         45   not accepted.  Therefore, the petitioners themselves  are aware of the  alternate procedure w hich may be  triggered in the circumstances of the case and which  were not found  in the Act, 1913.  The mere fact  that new provisions in the form of section 290 and  291 have been inserted, enlarge the  suo motu   powers  of this Court to make such order as it d eems fit.   This was not the case hithertobefore  and thus it was  not within the contemplation of the Supreme Court  of Pakistan at the time of the decision of Ladli  Prasad case.   3 6 .   Another provision which is of recent origin  and has been inserted in Ordinan ce, 1984 is  sub - section  (2) of section  314 which relates to the  powers of Court  on  hearing a petition.  By  subsection (2) of  section   314, where a petition is  presented on the ground that it is just and equitable  that the company should be wound up, the Cou rt  may refuse to make an order of winding up if it is of  the opinion that some other remedy is available to  the petitioners and they are acting unreasonably in  seeking to have the company wound up instead of  pursuing that  other  remedy.

The petitioners obviously had these  provisi ons in mind when an alternate prayer under  section 290 was made.  It is obvious, therefore,  that  the arguments of the learned counsel for the  petitioners to the effect that in case of a deadlock  amongst the shareholders the only option left with  the Court  is to wind up the company, is flawed and  no more good law .  It  does not take into account the  change in law which has been brought about after  the decision so rendered in Ladli Prasad case.  The  correct view, in my opinion, would be that in case of  allegat ion s   of a deadlock between the shareholders,  winding up of the company is not the only option  with the Court and with the change in law periphery  of the powers of the Court have been enlarged by  the insertion of section 290 read with section 314  (2)  of the   Ordinance, 1984 and thus the Court has  sufficient powers to make such orders as it thinks fit  in the facts and circumstances of the case.

That will not be in  consonance with the true state of law   in a given set  of circumstances, that may still be resorted to.   However, the correct position is that the Court is  now vested with wide range of powers with greater  latitud e when a petition on this ground is presented.   37.   I may hasten to add that an order under  section 290 can only be made upon a petition so  presented to the Court.  The petitioners have made  that petition and so this Court can proceed to  consider the altern ate options spelt out in section  290.  Had there been no petition, the only option  for this Court was either to order for winding up of  the Company or to dismiss it on the basis of section  314(2) by forming an opinion that some other  remedy was available t o the petitioners and that they  are acting unreasonably in seeking to have the  Company wound up instead of pursuing that other  remedy.    3 8 .   The circumstances of the present case, in my  opinion, do not justify the  passing of an order for  the winding up of t he company.

The learned counsel for the petitioners has  sought to  built his arguments around the audit  reports filed by the auditor appointed by this Court  on 27.6.2011.  Suffice to say that the observ ations  of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Ladli Prasad  case and reproduced above would squarely apply to  rebut the arguments of the learned counsel for the  petitioners.   Matters must be decided and rights  must be determined and adjudged according to the  l egal position prevailing of the date of the  institution of the proceedings  for winding up and  not on the basis of changes which have since been  introduced  pendente   lite .   The auditor was  ',\n",

The auditor was  appointed purely for the purposes of determining  the breakup value of the shares and no more.   It was  not meant to add to the armoury  to any of the  parties in attackin g the other party or to buil d   upon  the case set up in the petition itself.  This cannot be  countenanced.   The audit report submitted can only  be used for the purposes of the determination of  breakup value and the petitioners cannot be heard to  resile from  that position to the detriment of the  respondents.  Be that as it may, it is the   own case that  a special audit was directed to be  conducted by the SECP, which issue is  sub   judice   before the Islamabad High Court and can be  determined on its own   merits.  It cannot be used to  the advantage of the petitioners or to bolster the  case set up initially by the petitioners.   4 1 .   The facts brought forth do not justify the  winding up of the  Company  on just and equitable  grounds.  The ground of oppression co ntained in  clause (f) of section 305, too, has not been brought  home by the petitioners.  From the documents  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         51   brought on record, it seems that the petitioner No.1  has been an active member of the management of the  Company.  Things got pear - shaped only upon  commencement of litigation between the  shareholders (who are related inter se) and a race for  control of the Company ensued thereafter.  It is  highly doubtful if the ground of there being a  deadlock remains available to the petitioners after  the acquisitio n of 2% shares by respondent No.2  which tilts the balance in favour of the respondents.    Upon a holistic consideration of the facts laid bare,  the instant petition seems a culmination in the  struggle for wresting control of the company by the  two groups an d serves individual and private interest  rather than the public interest or the interest of the  members generally.  It is not based on just and  equitable considerations but for narrow and  pedantic motives.  In the process the goose that lays  golden eggs is   sought to be culled.  The pendency of  CO No.52 of 2006, is an indication of the means  employed by the parties to take control of the  Company.

This document is not denied  by the learned counsel for the parties.  However, the  fact is that the understanding contained in this  document did not materialize and the parties  decided not to adhere to the terms of this  MOU/agreement.

These  include the signing of the cheques as also certain  monetary disputes between the parties which was  agreed to be settled through a separate agreement.

This also means that the petitioners reposed  from confidence in the management being led by the  respondent No.2 and that there was no dispute on  that account.  No mention was made in the MOU  with regard to the serious management issues or  oppression of the minority nor was it reflected in  the MOU that diversion or siphoning off of the  funds had taken   place.   4 3 .

During the pendency of  the winding up petition, an application was  submitted under  section 290 of the Ordinance,  1984 with the prayer that the respondents be  directed to sell their shares to the applicants who  were willing to purchase the same in proportion of  the shareholding  on  a price fixed by the auditors of  the Company.    On this app lication, the Company  Bench proceeded to appoint two firms of chartered  accountants in order to fix the value of the shares of  the Company.  The following portions of the  judgment of the Karachi High Court in the said case  have been relied upon by the lear ned counsel for the  respondents as being fully applicable to the facts in  the instant petition.  It was held by the Karachi  High Court that:   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         58    plain reading of section 290 of the Companies  Ordinance is sufficient t o suggest that an  application under section 290 of the companies  Ordinance could be made by any of the parties to  the winding up petition if the requirements of  subsection (1) of section 290 are in - existence  and also empowers the Court to make such order  a s may be deemed fit with a view to bring an end  to the matters complained of either by  regularizing the affairs of the company in future  or directing the purchase of shares of the  oppressed members of the company either by the  company or by other members i f the winding up  of the company would unfairly prejudice the  share -     ordering winding up of a company and  appointing a Liquidator has the power to  appoint an administrator to ru n and manage the  company as winding up would not be just and  equitable, the Court would also have the power  to take action in the nature of directions for sale  of the share - holdings of minority members to the  majority sh a re - holders for keeping the company  alive and to continue to run its affairs provided  that such action is in the interest of the majority  share - holders, creditors and the persons having  dealings with the company.  In the circumstances,  the contention of Mr. A.I. Chundrigar that in a  situatio n where the two erring parties are relating  to each other and have lost confidence in each  other on account of mismanagement and  oppression the only solution would be to wind  up the company by having recourse to section  290 of the Companies Ordinance is wi thout any      Mr.   A.I.  Chundrigar is devoid of force in view of the fact  that respondents 1and 2 had consented to have  the price or the value of the share of Shan  Hospital fixed by the two Char tered Accountants  appointed by each of the erring parties, whereby  they had consented to accept the price/value of  the share determined or fixed by the two  Chartered Accountants.  Admittedly both the  Chartered Accountants had not arrived at one  and the sam e value and had valued the share  differently.  This fact would not deter the Court  ',\n",

It follows from the portions reproduced   above that the Karachi High Court dilated upon the  scope of section 290 and the powers conferred  therein upon the Company Bench.  It was held that  if the requirements of section 290 were in existence,  the Court was empowered to make such order as it  deems   fit with a view to bring an end to the matters  complained of and one of the modes in which the  matters could be redressed was by directing the  purchase of shares of the oppressed members of the  company either by the company or by other  members.  Another f actor which bears similarity  between the  Tasnim  case and the present case is that  application was  made by the respondents in that case  to have the price or value of the shares determined  by two Chartered Accountants and thereby consent  was given to  accept  the price of the shares  ',\n",

This was  reiterated on 31.12.2014 and the Chartered  Accountant was required to file his report before the  next date of hearing.  By all means, this was a  consensual  order and in acknowledgement thereof   signatures have been fixed on the margins of t he  order sheet by the respective parties.

(5)   That if a shareho lder brings a  petition for winding up of a  company, the Court will, inter alia,  consider the factum whether  majority of shareholders and large  number of creditors are opposing  the petition.    (6)   That while considering a petition  for winding up the ground of la ck  of probity  must be against the  interest of the company itself and  on behalf of the company and not  in relation to the public exchequer.

Macleod, J. in re Pioneer Bank, Ltd. AIR 1914  Bombay 190 stated that a petition by a  shareholder for winding up stands on a di fferent  footing to a petition by a creditor. It should be  scrutinized more carefully.         The misconduct of the Director or that  the business has been carried on a heavy loss are  even not a ground on which the Court would  order for winding up. The Courts ha ve laid  down special rule in exercising their discretion in  winding up a company on the petition of a share - holder that the Court to bear in mind that the  internal management of the company is its own  concern, and it is a much better judge of business  pros pects of a trading venture than the Court can  ever hope to be. If, therefore, the majority of the  shareholders show confidence in the management  of the company and have faith in its future  prospects, the Court has rarely interfered.

An important  finding of the Karachi High Court was that if the  majority of the shareholders show confidence in the  management of the company and have voted for its  future prospect the Court must give way and   should  not inter fere on a winding up petition.   4 9 .   Giving a survey of the grounds on which the  Courts have generally refused to order a winding up  on the just and equitable ground, it was held that  mere allegations of mismanagement or  misappropriation of  funds by the directors without  more will not be a ground sufficient to wind up the  company.  Similar is the position when there are  allegations of grouping and partisanship amongst the  shareholders which too has not been accepted as  sufficient to wind up t he company.   It was  concluded by the Karachi High Court that:     section 305 ibid clearly indicates that it is the  matter of discretion of the Court whether, in the  ',\n",

This means that it is only where the balance of  equities is shown by petition to tilt appreciably in  favour   of a winding up order that it will be made   a petition relying on grounds contained in  section 305 can get a winding up order as a  matter of right. It is issued as a matter of right  when it produces a   compelling effect. It is not  granted mechanically as a matter of course on  proof of certain fact. In other words, equitable  considerations have a decisive effect even when  the power to wind up a company is involved  under a clause of section 305 of the Ord inance.    50 .

The second principle approved was  that the Courts wi ll not intervene at the  instance of shareholders in matters of internal  management of the company by directors so  long as they are acting within the powers  conferred on them by the Articles of the  Company.  The third principle approved was  that the doctrin  (1924) All ER 200 namely that if a private  company or in a public company which is in  the nature of private company there is lack of  confidence that would be the ground for an  order for winding up but that lack of  confidence must   arise not because the  aggrieved party is in minority but must arise  from the lack of probity in the conduct of the  affairs of the Company.    29.   Some of the important principles  which clearly emerge from the precedents  analysed above are that unwise, ineff icient or  careless conduct of a director in pursuance of  the duties cannot give rise to a claim for relief  under section 290 Companies Ordinance,  1984.

At this point,  I  may refer to the comparable  law in England.  Most of the relevant provisions  governi ng the operations of the companies is to be  found within the 1300 provisions and 16 Schedules  of Companies Act, 2006.  The predecessor of  Companies Act, 2006 was Companies Act, 1985  and Companies Act, 1989.  Companies Act, 2006  either restates or amends al most all provisions of  Act, 1985 and Act, 1989.  The matters relating to   contained in section 994 f of Act, 2006, which gives  the Court on the application of a member a wide  ranging power of remedying the  conduct of   interest of the members generally or to some part of  its members.  However, the doctrinal basis of section  994 can still be derived from the earlier provisions  of section 459 in Companies Act , 1985 and those  provisions and the case law developed on their basis  still remains relevant.  Section 994 requires the   being or have been conducted in a manner unfairly  ',\n",

       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         71   In the case of s 459, the background  has the following two features.  First, a  company is an association of persons for an  economic purpose, usually entered into with  legal advice and some degree of formality.    The terms of the association are contained in  the articles of association and sometimes in  collateral agreements between the  shareholders.  Thus the manner in which the  affairs of the company may be conducted is  closely regulated by rules to which the  sha reholders have agreed.  Secondly, company  law has developed seamlessly from the law of  partnership, which was treated by equity, like  the Roman societas, as a contract of good  faith.  One of the traditional roles of equity,  as a separate jurisdiction, was  to restrain the  exercise of strict legal rights in certain  relationships in which it considered this  would be contrary to good faith.  These  principles have, with appropriate  modification, been carried over into company  law.   The  first of these two feature s leads to  the conclusion that a member of a company  will not ordinarily be entitled to complain of  unfairness unless there has been some breach  of the terms on which he agreed that the  affairs of the company should be conducted.   But the second leads to t he conclusion that  there will be cases in which equitable  considerations make it unfair for those  conducting the affairs of the company to rely     53 .   As stated above, the buy - out of shares is the  most common remedy which is a vailable to a  petitioner in a petition alleging unfairly prejudicial  conduct.  The courts in England have laid down  different standards for valuing shares in buy - out   valuation of shares has been taken into  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         72   consideration.  In Bird Precision Bellows Ltd (1984)  Ch 419, Nourse J had the following comments to  make with regard to the  relevance     conduct:    cases where purchase orders are made under s  75 in relation to  quasi - partnerships the  vendor is unwilling in the sense that the sale  has been forced upon him.  Usually he will be  a minority shareholder whose interests have  been unfairly prejudiced by the manner in  which the affairs of the company have been  conducted b y the majority.  On the  assumption that the unfair prejudice has made  it no longer tolerable for him to retain his  interest in the company, a sale of his shares  will invariably be his only practical way out  short of a winding up.  In that kind of case it  s eems to me that it would not merely not be  fair, but most unfair, that he should be  bought out on the fictional basis applicable to  a free election to sell his shares in accordance   indeed on any other basis wh ich involved a  discounted price.  In my judgment the correct  course would be to fix the price pro rata  according to the value of the shares as a whole  and without any discount, as being the only  fair method of compensating an unwilling  vendor of the equiva lent of a partnership   purchase of the shares of the delinquent  majority, it would not merely not be fair, but  most unfair, that they should receive a price     5 4 .   The date o f valuation of shares is another  issue which will confront the Court making a buy - out order.  In Profinance Trust SA v Gladstone  (2002) 1 WLR 1024, it was held that:   ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         73    The starting point should in our view  be the general proposition stated by Nourse J  in In   re London School of Electronic Ltd   in a going concern ought to be valued at the   That is, as Nourse J said, subject to the  overriding requirement that the valuation   should be fair on the facts of the particular  case.   The general trend of authority over the  last 15 years appears to us to support that as  the starting point, while recognising that there  are many cases in which fairness (to one side  or the other) require s the court to take     5 5 .   But one of the classic statements on the value  to be put on the shares is found in Scottish Co - operative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer (1959)  AC 324 (House of Lords) in the words of Lord  Denning:    Your Lordships were  referred to Bell  v Lever Bros Ltd, where Lord Blanesburgh  said that a director of one company was at  liberty to become a director also of a rival  company.  That may have been so at that  time.  But it is at the risk now of an  application under s 210 if he s ubordinates the  interests of the one company to those of the  other.   So I would hold that the affairs of the  textile company were being conducted in a  manner oppressive to Dr Meyer and Mr     One of the most useful orders  mentioned in the section  which w ill enable  the court to do justice to the injured  shareholders  is to order the oppressor to  buy their shares at a fair price: and a fair price  would be, I think, the value which the shares  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         74   would have had at the date of the petition, if  there had been no op    5 6 .   To reiterate, a compulsory buy - out at a fair  price has become the most useful remedy in England  and in the majority of cases, it has become almost  the only remedy called upon in these cases.  We may  also make a reference to the observations  on the  subject made in   Modern Company Law   Seventh Edition.     While  discussing the remedy under section 461 and the  wide remedial discretion of the Court to make such  order as it does have, it has been stated that:    purchase order gives the  petitioner an opportunity to exit from the  company with the fair value of his or her  investment, something which, in the absence  of a court order, is often not available to the  shareholder in a small company, because no  potential p urchasers of the shares are available  or, even if they were, because of pre - emption  rights in the articles in favour of the other  shareholders, i.e. the controllers.   The crucial question in this buy - out  process is how is the court to assess the  fairness of   the price to be paid for the shares.  Two important issues have emerged in the  valuation process. The first is whether the   rata to the total value of the company or  whether its value should be discounted on th e  basis that it is ex hypothesi a minority holding  and so does not carry with it control of the  company. In Re Bird Precision Bellows Ltd it  was established the principle was pro rata  valuation because the buy - out had been  forced upon the minority by the u nlawful acts  of the controllers. However, the court  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         75    not been blameless, the value of the  shareholding might be discounted for its  minority status. Further, if the petitioner had  bought the shareholding at a pr ice which  reflected its minority status or it had devolved  upon him or her by operation of law, the full  pro rata value might not be appropriate.    normally override any provisions of the     at least  where they are less favourable to the minority.   At one time it was thought that the minority  could, in effect, be forced to use the share - purchase and associated valuation provisions  in the articles, where they existed, on the  grounds that an of fer by the controllers to  purchase on the basis set out in the articles  deprived their previous conduct of its quality  of unfair prejudice.  Although motivated by a  laudable desire to encourage the parties to  settle their differences without coming to  cour t, the approach suffered from the fact  that the articles often did not guarantee the  minority pro rata valuation.  It now seems to  have been abandoned although an open offer  on a pro rata basis, which would give the  petitioner all he could reasonably expec t if the  petition were successful, will make it an abuse  of process for the petitioner to continue.   The second issue concerns timing.  The value  put on shares, whether on a pro rata or on a  discounted basis, will often crucially depend  on when the value of   the company is assessed.   The courts have given themselves the widest  discretion to choose the most appropriate  date.  The normally competing dates are a  date close to when the shares are to be  purchased and the date when the petition was  presented.  In P rofinance Trust SA v  Gladstone, the Court of Appeal thought that  the former had become the presumptive  valuation date, but that there were many  circumstances when an earlier date might be  chosen, for example, where the unfairly  prejudicial conduct had reco nstructed its  business or even that there had been a general  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         76   fall in the market since the presentation of the     5 7 .   The restatement of the principles of law can   Modern Company Law (Seventh Edition),   p 526):    The area of general legal protection  for minority shareholders is now dominated  by the unfair prejudice remedy, but, despite  the remedial flexibility of s 461, the court  cannot order the winding up of the company  in question.  The Law Commission  recommended that that part should be added  to the range of remedies available to the court  for the redress of unfair prejudice, but the  CLR rejected it on the grounds that it was  open to abuse for the reasons discussed  below.  Nevertheless there is a separ ate  procedure which a minority shareholder may  seek to use to have the company wound up.   A company may be wound up compulsorily  by the court on a petition presented to it by a  contributory if the court is of the opinion  that it is just and equitable to do   so.  This  provision, now contained in s 122 (1)(g) of  the Insolvency Act, 1986, has a long pedigree  in the law relating to companies, and the  power can be traced back to the Joint Stock  Companies Winding up Act 1848.  The  provision was influenced by the ( then  uncodified) partnership law and was  originally used mainly n cases where the  company was deadlocked.  In the course of  this century it has been moulded by the courts  into a means of subjecting small private  companies to equitable principles derived  fr om partnership law then they wre in reality  incorporated partnerships.  As we have seen,  the apotheosis of this use of the section, the  decision of the House of Lords in Ebrahimi v  Vestbourne Galleries Ltd, was highly  influential in the courts development  of their  powers under s 459.  Despite its remarkable  substantive development, the provision always  suffered from a weakness at the remedial level:  if the company was prospering, presenting a  ',\n",

So long as the alternative remedy was  hobbled by the restrictive wording and  interpretation of s 210 of the Companies Act  1948, the winding up petition was better than  nothing.  But, with the introduction of the  unfair prej udice remedy, one may wonder  what its appropriate role in the scheme of  things now is.     Pt of the answer to this question lies in  purely tactical considerations on the part of  the petitioners.  A winding up petitioner  triggers s 127 of the Insolvency Act  1986,  which requires the courts consent for any   the petition is presented.  This ability to  paralyze or at least disrupt, the normal   the negotiating strength of the pet itioner but  is hardly legitimate if a s 459 petition could  give him or her all that is required.   Consequently, a Practice Direction seeks to  discourage the routine joining of winding up  petitions to unfair prejudice claims, unless a  winding up remedy is w hat is genuinely  sought.  The force behind the Practice  Direction is provided by s 125(2) of the  Insolvency Act 1986, to the effect that the  court need not grant a winding up order if it  is of the opinion that some alternative remedy  is available to the pe titioners and that they  have acted unreasonably is not pursuing it.  It  would not seen an unreasonable use of this  power for the courts to insist that, where a  more flexible s 459 remedy is available, the  petitioner should be confined to it.  That  would be   a natural consequence of the fact  that the statutory alternative to a winding up  order has finally come of age.     However, another part of the answer  lies in the long running controversy over  whet4hr the grounds of unfairness upon  which a company can be w ound up under s  122 (1)(g) of the 1986 Act are wider than  those which will found an unfair prejudice  remedy under s 459 of the 1985 Act.  There  ',\n",

As adumbrated, the order of this Court dated  27.6.2011 brought a shift in the course of the  proceedings in the instant petition.

The terms  of the reference to the Chartered Accountant were  agreed to by the parties by acknowledging and by  affixing  their signatures   on the sideline of the order.   One of the terms of reference was that the accounts  of the company were to be audited in accordance  with law and the required valuation of the  shares  ',\n",

A  report in pursuance of the  order of this Court was  submitted by the Chartered Accountant so  appointed on 10.09.2012.  The parties have  filed  objections to the report  submitted by the Chartered  Accountant.  In my opinion, however, since the  matter was referred to the Chartered Accoun tant by  consent, by impl ication , the parties chose not to  raise any objection to the valuation made by the  Chartered Accountant as this would involve the  parties in a  never  ending vortex  of  objections and  cross objections which runs counter to the intentio n  and spirit of the order dated 27.6.2011.  On  31.12.2014, this Court once again required the  auditors to carryout the audit of UIL for the period  from 01.7.2011 to 31.12.2014 and to submit the  repo r t together with the value of the shares  calculated in ter ms of the order dated 27.6.2011.   This order   has not been challenged by any of the  parties and effectively overrides the objections which  any party may have to the earlier report submitted  by the auditor.

It will be noticed that the effect of audit  qualifications has been added back while calculating  the valuation of the shares o f the Company.  The  breakup value per share based on the various factors  which have been reproduced above,  comes  to  Rs.601/ - .    This is based on the audited accounts as  on December 31, 2014.   61 .   The learned counsel for the petitioners at the  conclusions of  his arguments passionately urged that  the petitioners would  acquiesce   on a buy - out  arrangements under section 290 if a special audit  was conducted.  By this, the learned counsel sought  to bring home his allegation that massive and serious  fraud had been co nducted in the running of the  affairs of the Company and thus it was well - nigh  impossible to calculate the breakup value of the  shares and any calculation, therefore, without a  special audit being conducted, would be a nullity  and an exercise without purpo se.  Firstly, no prayer  has been made  in the petition for a special audit to  be conducted.  It  purely lies within the discretion of  ',\n",
       " 'C.O  No. 35  of 20 06         82   this Court to conduct a special audit or not.   Secondly, a special audit can only be conducted by  the Commission on its own  motion or upon an  application made by members holding not less than  20% voting right in a company.  That right has been  exercised by the petitioners and of which  proceedings have been set in motion by the SECP.   Thos proceedings are under challenge before  the  Islamabad High Court.  It would thus not serve any  purpose for this Court to order a special audit which  would only result in duplication.  Further, this  stance of the learned counsel for the petitioners is a  deviation from the consensual order of 27.6 .2011  and the petitioners cannot be permitted to change  their stance at their whim according to the  circumstances.  The plea of special audit has been  developed by the learned counsel for the petitioners  after the report of the auditors ha d   been submitted  on 10.09.2012 in which, according to the learned  counsel, certain qualifications ha d   been mentioned  which  allegedly  point to fraudulent activities in the  conduct of the affairs of the company.

I have not put that report to the parties for inviting  objections as that was not the mandate of the  appointment by consent.

       " 'In response to an advertisement by the Government inviting applications for allotment of plots \\nreserved in Scheme Nos. l and 3 in Tariq Bin Ziad Colony, Sahiwal,\\n \\nfor Overseas Pakistanis, \\nrespondent Dr. Talat Nadeem and respondent No.5 Muhammad Ilyas applied and, in the draw of \\nlots, Plot No.9 in Scheme No. l was drawn in favour of respondent No. 1 Dr. Talat Nadeem \\nwhereas Plot No. 11 was drawn in favour of respond\\nent No.5 Muhammad Ilyas. Subsequently, \\nthe Government officials concerned informed respondent that Plot No.9 had been allotted in \\nfavour of Mst. Shahnaz Saif and the respondent No. l had been given Plot No. 11 (drawn in \\nfavour of respondent No.5 Muhammad I\\nlyas) and respondent No. 5 was informed that he was \\nbeing given Plot No. 1\\n-\\nA which was still to be created in Scheme No. 1.\\n \\n \\n \\nHowever, Plot No. 11 could not be given to respondent No. l as Muhammad Ilyas had, in the \\nmeantime, filed Writ Petition No. 3324 o\\nf 1993 in which stay order had been issued. Respondent \\nNo. l Dr. Talat Nadeem, then filed his Writ Petition No. 4788 of 1993. In the writ petition it was \\npleaded by the petitioner that she being widow had applied for allotment of plots in Low Price \\nHousing\\n \\nScheme No.III and under the orders of the then Chief Minister two plots measuring 7 \\nMarlas each in the said scheme were allotted to her and at her request there was exchange of the \\ntwo plots (total being 14 Marlas) with Plot No. 9\\n-\\nZ (which had been drawn \\nin favour of \\nrespondent No. l) which plea of the petitioner was not accepted.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe reasoning of the High Court in allowing both the writ petitions is contained in paras. 7 to 11 \\nof the impugned judgment which are reproduced here:\\n-\\n \\n \\n \\n\"7. After hearing the \\nlearned counsel for the parties I have reached the conclusion that both these \\nwrit petitions merit acceptance.\\n \\n \\n \\nBoth Dr. Talat Nadeem and Muhammad Ilyas (petitioners in these two writ petitions) are \\nPakistanis living abroad, former being resident of Irela\\nnd and the latter of U.S. A, Plots Nos. 9 \\nand l I were reserved for overseas Pakistanis. Both the writ petitions were successful, in draw of \\nlots; Plot No.9 drawn in the name of Dr. Talat Nadeem and Plot No. 11 to Muhammad IIyas. \\nBoth, as such, acquired ve\\nsted rights in these plots. However, respondent No.4 manoeuvred in \\nobtaining an order from the Chief Minister, Punjab, for allotment of Plot No.9 in her favour, and \\nthus, shifting of Talat Nadeem to Plot No.9 and Muhammad Ilyas to Plot No. 1\\n-\\nA.\\n \\n \\n \\nIt is ope\\nn to serious doubt as to whether the Chief Minister, Punjab, was competent to pass the \\norder of her shifting to Plot No. 9\\n-\\nZ. Be that as it may, admittedly neither of the two petitioners \\nin these writ petitions were afforded an opportunity of hearing by an\\ny one before passing the \\nimpugned order Annexure\\n-\\nIV.

No reason is forthcoming either as to why \\nshe was beings plot measuring I Kanal instead of two plots of 7 Marlas each.

       " ' \\n \\n10. However, as per report of the municipal engineer respondent, No.4 has spent a sum of \\nRs.77,700 for raising bounda\\nry wall over Plot No.9\\n-\\nZ.

It may be noticed that \\no\\nn behalf of respondent No.4 no serious objection was raised with regard to the assessment of \\nthe amount spent on the construction in question.\\n \\n \\n \\n11. It is accordingly directed that the petitioner would pay a sum of Rs.77,700 to respondent No. \\n4 before he i\\ns inducted into possession of Plot No.9\\n-\\nZ and issued transfer documents in respect \\nthereof after clearance of the dues. The petitioner in the connected writ petition is held entitled to \\nretain Plot No.11, earlier drawn in his name..
